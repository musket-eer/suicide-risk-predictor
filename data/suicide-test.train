1	Im so lostHello my name is Adam 16 and Ive been struggling for years and Im afraid Through these past years thoughts of suicide fear anxiety Im so close to my limit  Ive been quiet for so long and Im too scared to come out to my family about these feelings About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all Everyday feeling hopeless  lost guilty and remorseful over her and all the things Ive done in my lifebut thoughts like these with the little Ive experienced in life Only time Ive revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt ODoverdose from pills and attempt hanging All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because Im still so afraid During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression social anxiety and a eating disorderIm so scared I might do something drastic Ive been shaped by fear and anxiety Idk what to do anymore
1	Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can I feel like im loosing my girlfriend I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good Im behind on my education i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed I have no hopes or dreams I care about nothing not family not friends not even my girlfriend i still love her its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it and knowing im that weak makes me sadder The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty because as bad as it is im used to it its my way of being normal I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyoneI know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me Ill probably suvive they might not Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak while they could cure cancer or something usefulSorry for wasting your time
1	Trigger warning Excuse for self inflicted burnsI do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attackI know its not a healthy thing to doBut I did I did something stupid out of impulse I burned myself  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history we were together 12 years Hes seen my at my worst  but I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists Im thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts I did work on my car last night and I hadnt self harmed in a LONG time I just did it without thinking as usual impulse and lost in the momentShould I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist They are about an inch long kind of wide and a little deep I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine I do not want to self harm again I just need to be able to explain this

1	Do you think getting hit by a train would be painfulGuns are hard to come by in my country but trains are not I just dont want to suffer though do you think this would be a painless method of suicide
1	death continuedI posted here before and saw something interesting  I asked for information  You know what I got back  A bunch of people who wanted to do the same thing to me as they always do spit back personal information about me  This makes things worse obviously but at least a bunch of trolls are having laughsIn the end my desire to selfterminate grows stronger  I have so little left now but still have the same bitterness just a bit stronger now  The main goal throughout the process is to minimize the subsequent fallout  It would certainly have been nice had the patrons of this forum been more respectful of my privacy but that was obviously a bit of a ridiculous expectation considering the source

1	Im scared   Everything just seems to be getting worse and worse Im young and I think Im transgender but Im not even sure about that I cant tell if Im just lying to myself or if Im actually trans I feel so overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions and I cant just take it anymore    I just wish I could at least know for sure if I was trans and even then I have to worry about if my religious family will be accepting and if I can actually do anything to alleviate my pain a bit   I cut myself for the first time yesterday I barely even drew blood so I cant even fucking hurt myself correctly I dont think Ill ever be able to do anything correctly I want to pursue music but I know theres no money to be found in that field unless I become famous but thats not happening    Currently Im not seriously debating suicide but the thoughts keep coming back and they just keep getting worse Im not sure if I can really take this much longer I just wish I was born a girl I want to cry

1	Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteriaI am trapped inside a void  There is absolutely nothing for me  I go through the monotonous tasks of everyday life with nothing to look forward to no aspirations whatsoever  The only saving grace I felt like I had the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted and accepted me for who I am was Maren  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds and shes assured me that it is talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day  It was the one thing that kept me going knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her even if only briefly before we went to sleepShe made me feel accepted  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth  She made me feel like I could actually like myself and be okay with who I was  But most of all she made me feel loved  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely  I felt completely at ease when talking with her  Ive told her things that no one else in the world knows about me and she made me feel like she actually cared about them that she cared about me  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else  We talked about getting together being with each other devising crazy scenarios with how to be together  We talked all the time nothing could keep us apart  Except for Ty  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the breakup with Starr  She talked to me whenever I needed her and she always made me feel better about it  She was my shining star in a pitchblack sky  None of this is any longer thoughWe have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me and I dont blame her  I do nothing but hurt her these days  None of it is intentional but it happens nonetheless  When we first started talking again I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that  I suppose she thought I was overexaggerating but I wasnt  I need to have interaction in my life  I know it is not fair to the people around me and I know that it is not what they want but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time  My thoughts are extremely selfdestructive  I need someone to spend time with someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts  For about four months I was legitimately happy  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy  I was finally over Starr thanks to the help from Maren  I had no stress at all things were actually looking up even my migraines were becoming few and far between  I was in love and I felt loved  If I could go back in time and replay those four months over and over again I would without hesitation  That was the best time of my life  I didnt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control  I didnt have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside  I could share them with Maren and she was incredibly receptive  I didnt have to lie about who I was or leave details out  Maren made me feel like I was a good person  I told her about my past and she seemed genuinely concerned for me  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself  She told me that I was attractive something I had never been told before not even by Starr who I was together with for ten years  I was happy with who I was at that time  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself  But with her we would send each other snapchat pictures and she made me feel like I wasnt the hideous person that I thought myself to be  In hindsight I am sure that she was just being nice to me and that she did not actually think I was attractive  It was still nice to hear it thoughI miss those days  I long for them to return but I know that that will never happen  The same thing has happened with many people before though none to that extreme  They are fine with me when we first start talking and eventually they realise how highmaintenance and fucked up I am  That causes them to drift away until eventually we stop talking altogether or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives  That was the case with Starr  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me  In the morning she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again  After ten years of being together she ended it on a whim and caused me to lose not only my significant other but also my best friend  The same thing is happening with Maren  I am driving her away and eventually I will not have a best friend again  I will be completely alone  The last time I was completely alone right after Starr broke up with me I didnt leave my room for two weeks  I didnt eat a single thing in those two weeks  I laid there in bed staring at my ceiling in the darkness constantly in tears trying to realise where I had gone wrong  I have never cried so much in my life  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life but at that moment I could not contain them any longer  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world and that is how I feel again right nowIt was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again  I have no idea at all how to make friends  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever I was prepared to either be completely ignored or told to go away  That didnt happen though  We had a wonderful conversation reminiscing about our childhood  I dont remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr but I told her everything and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it  She stayed up with me until the morning just talking with me on Facebook  I was in tears for most of that conversation partly because I was still upset about the breakup but also because I couldnt believe that someone actually cared  Especially someone I hadnt talked to in over a decade  When we started to get close and revealed our feelings for one another we joked about how us reconnecting was a red string of fate  I dont believe in fate but I also dont think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment when I felt like I had nothing left  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else  I am incredibly socially awkward I cannot make new friends at all  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety  Online I just have nothing to say  I am a boring person  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits rr4r rkikpals and the like  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice but none of them developed into an actual friendship  They all stopped talking to me after one session  I dont have anything at all to give in a friendshipAfter fighting with Maren and being told that I cant keep badgering her to hang out with me when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend who was her ex my selfworth is absolutely rock bottom  She has made me realise that I am the problem that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship but I see now that it was never her fault  I am just completely unlovable  I can never have more than one true friend  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up I had very few friends and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly every time  Because of this I latch on to the one friend I have  I suffocate them  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more and leave me  I have tried so hard to give her space and not ask her to hang out with me or talk to me but whenever I try I get extremely depressed  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no I get a sinking feeling  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy we did everything together  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something she was happy to hang out with me  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me  I have very little to offer it was mainly her driving everything and that must have been exhaustingI am getting tired of writing though  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them  I have lived with them my entire life and not a single person has stayed around because of them  I am writing this because I now have zero friends  I am completely alone  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth or faded into oblivionGoodbyeSteven

0	Not having a crush during quarantine So Ive never had a girlfriend Last year was the first year I actually tried to make an attempt to date but all of those fucked up and Im in quarantine now And right now Im feeling like shit because I dont have a crush That may sound pathetic but even though it was quarantine and its not a good idea to start a relationship during quarantine and probably wouldnt but it was still nice to have someone to think about A lot of nights I just feel hollow Its not necessarily a feeling Its the absence of one I dont know I might sounds stupid right now just need to get some stuff out
1	Wheres the loveI live in this world and its not like your imaginings The books you read have little relevancePeople like to get by and they do so relatively quickly and without response  as do you And so it goes on So why not die why imagine that this world is somehow more special than it actually isIve been alone for so long and for little reason I dont approach anyone thay is my fault but ly god are people in general boring spews of nothiny and if not then they are hipsters with judgements And that can be fun but its just an empty form of stimulation  I want to go Im tired of trying for the few days of fun but emptiness

1	Anyone planning suicide in the longterm futureIm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe 45 yearsWhy do I want to kill myselfIts kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Familyalong with a lack of purpose or inherent value of lifeEconomicGrowing up was hard and Ive had to overcome a lot of adversity lowerincome household mother dying ata young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people hereIm in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenialMy parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different schoolor even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campusthat I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didnt have a good sense of directionor idea for a majorcareer and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didnt have the resources or finances firstgeneration college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academicallybut since my majordepartment is kinda shitty applied math Im worried that I wont get a good paying job unlikeengineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave collegenext year with about 2528K in loansFamilyGenerally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the houseas fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becomingselfsufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though hes pretty oldand should be focusing on retirement I havent come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of itnot super religous but super conservative strict and familyoriented My parents are also immigrants so we dont havetons of wealthy family hereHealthI have a lot of chronic probably geneticallycaused health diseases since I was youngWhen I was young and in my midteens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportiveAfter my mom died my dad didnt bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialistsanymore my health has decreased Its hard at college too because I dont have a car and I didnt always havehealth insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These arentlifethreatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and selfconsciousSo because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I dont want to kill myself yet but in 34 yearswhen I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicideplanning once Im in the real worldIve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending evenIt seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a firstgeneration college student background with severlylimited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even 5 years And itshard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and uppermiddle class families succeed in life when its aconstant struggle for meAnd even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery whats the point Why suffer andstruggle so much in life if I dont really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreedwith me and is truly planning suicide in the futureIm also fine with talking to people about my choices andorexpanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mindTLDR Want to wait 34 years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living ifIm economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complexreasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and dont see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living
0	What the fuck I finally had the confidence to go meet someone in real life again I was really excited to see my only real life friend and we would just walk around in the city and shop a bit A few days ago my mum forced me to go on an activity I absolutely hate my parents always force me to du stuff I really dont wanna do Well it turns out on that free time activity I went to which I absolutely hated I talked to no one and just stayed away from everybody Someone MAYBE has covid so now I cant go to the city and I will miss the first two days of irl schools which would have given me a plan on how this school year starts Great Now I cried for the past two hours I was in a really good mood I was really looking forward to get my school life together and I built up the confidence and now I feel even worse than before and I fucking hate it
1	Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide and other parts of dealing with depressionIve been a little low lately so this matters to me Im long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater so it only hurts a littleI wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized And now as I am in the class that comes after that basic course I have to finish the script I like how the script has grown and changed and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions There is another character that is the voice of depression and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head It was like writing down my thoughts from the past Too easy to write which meant I could zoom past it faster but I could never watch this script come to life It would be too traumatic I couldnt let other people  see that too Especially people who know what its likeI know it isnt the same now that Im much better but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide or looking over the edge of a building sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldnt do it Confused if that was really what I wantedAnother complexity I feel like Ive become the expert on suicide hospitalization therapy group therapy antidepressants and depression within my class Too many scripts dont get it right Its never as straightforward as they write it Even now its not straightforward a part of me very small wants to kill myself A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants even if it means that I fall back into depression An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moments notice to just stop pain And now I will talk about the script during class like opening up too much of a wound We will see how much it bothers me I dont think it will too much but who knows rightSomeone in my class wasnt clear about what the character was doing accident or attempt To me it sounded like a suicide attempt and if it is well I guess Ill have to tell her that theres no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day Even if it is an accident someone would be asking her about her intentMy life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression Not that I dont have depression getting much closer to stable thoughI know this is long and I though this isnt entirely related But I just wanted to show this to people who know what its like to consider suicide or know a bit about the ambiguity treatment and reactions that follow it

1	I feel so hopelessHello I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or somethingOkay so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that Im gay This wouldnt be an issue if I didnt have strictly conservative parents I know a lot of people have it worse off than me but I feel like most of my problems stem from thisI havent been diagnosed as anything really but I dont really care because it doesnt take a fucking experts opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me Lately Ive been feeling more and more suicidal and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever And right before the time of this post in fact Ive cut myself for the first time Very shallow cuts 7 of them Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop even now  That and Ive been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now so yeah theres definitely something wrongTo further go into detail about the cutting looking back at it I snapped and started cutting going deeper than anything Ive tried to cut and with such force and pressure Im glad there was only an exacto knife nearby if anything else I think I may have bled out What scares me about this is 1 how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2 How the fuck Im going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up withAt the time of typing this yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall I obviously didnt do this and even if I were to walk out Id probably wouldnt because I felt like if I did Id just spread my suffering to my family About my family  As I stated previously theyre an adamant religious bunch and they have no tolerance for gays heresy and mental illness so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time Ill be honest its hard sometimes but I feel no sense of selfness I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay I try to make it seem like gay isnt even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldnt exist However recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything stressed over tiny things and that Im feeling like absolute shit and Ive been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me Im lazy and that even I couldnt amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered I just want someone to understand me and to love me for what I am and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me and that I need help but it just makes me so fucking sad that its never going to happen I dont even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down so I cant just do that I feel like I genuinely have nobody I feel so isolated and alone I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact but I cant help but feeling so fucking badI am scared that Im going to kill myself soon I just want things to stop being shit Ive been feeling like this on and off for almost 5Years no but in the past 4 months I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind I just want the pain to end I just want to not be alone and want someone to hug me and tell me Im valid
1	Just want people to know whats happening in my life since I cant really tell someone irl without them freaking out or somethingI really dont want to but stuff is going to happen soon resulting in me loosing my family school and my long term girlfriend Im really scared im a coward and honestly would rather be dead than try fix this mess Mess is putting it lightly though If my life was a large puzzle itd be like just throwing the entire thing in a fire of shame Im thinking about just cutting an artery but idt Id have the stomach for that but Ill figure something out I hear it takes a while to bleed out If you dont hit an artery so people are usually discovered and saved Fortunately I live alone in a dorm room and no one ever visits so I have a lot of time I wrote a note in class addressed to my girlfriend Looking back at it its kinda all over the place but I dont feel like fixing it I hear if you slit your arm it can cause permanent damage if you fuck up so I got some medical stuff just in case I wake up and decide not to try again right after I guess Im writing this here to make sure people know I dont have a history of depression and havent really shown any obvious reasons for something to think Id ever kill myself I feel a certain sense of control and calmness and Im actually looking forward to the time I have to make the decision If I decide to go through with it Ill let you guys know

1	No matter how many times it gets better I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and Im ready to lie in itIm 26 now have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my 12 year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment Its gotten better but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead mourning me and my choices is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations Today has particularly been a rocky day though and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakeningI started having ugly thoughts tonight like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out Im actually embarrassed to admit this but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires it scares meFor the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe but I dont know what I even need to say to him besides sorry Still this terrifies me but excites me I just crave life to be over so often and Im getting restlessNo matter what happens in life I always end up in the same place I keep fighting but Im wondering whos battle is this actually Im definitely not fighting for myself anymore Ive officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time

1	Best resource for mental health help for somebody without a lot of moneyIve been dealing with the death of my father for about a year and it comes and goes with how well I can actually deal with it  The past few months have been especially hard for some reason  I have very little money left no immediate family one friend I see once a week and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress and being around me doesnt make it any better  I have talked to both masters and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps  Talk therapy doesnt fix anything for me  Maybe its because my bachelors degree is in psychology but it never helps anythingThe days where I dont think about bad things are probably fewer than the ones where I do and that makes me so sadSometimes I feel like I cant do it anymore and it disappoints me because Ive got a lot going for me on paper got accepted back to college for a second bachelors degree recently but most days its a struggle just to wake up and go to my job  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me and I realize thats a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of meI was drinking a lot this past year but Ive been trying to quit for a few weeks too  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I dont sleep well where I get lost in my own thoughts and where I go to bad places quicklyI have many hobbies and I have passions but I have no passion for those passions on my bad daysI need to do something to fix myself  I dont want to have this constant cloud over me anymore  Any ideas as to what I should doI feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latterThanks for listening anyway helped to type that outEdit  To clarify I am talking about real actual mental health help  or perhaps medication  not reading self help books not going for a run not meditating  I have done all of those things ad nauseum  I do them regularly  I try to fill my life with as much of the positive lifestyle kind of stuff as I possibly can but its not working  Ive read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond  Respectfully please understand that telling me to just jog it off isnt going to help  I work out daily  I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy  I dont drink like a fish anymore  I need real help and I dont know what to do
1	I think I need to check myself into a hospital I need your guys advice4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder It wasnt really news Ive known Ive been depressed for years approaching 3 12 years now I got prescribed Zoloft and Im up to 75mg now Ive also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now Its not working though If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like its not even getting worse at a slower rateOver the last few years Ive made a lot of changes to try to help I went from 198 to 150 I started eating healthier I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects I transferred colleges since the first one wasnt working out I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends I even attended my first college party after 2 12 years of never being invited to anything Now Ive finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatricAnd none of it has helped If anything its only gotten worse since I dont even have the hope that any more changes will help The hope is gone When I was a kid I used to get Pneumonia a lot I had it like 5 times before I was 3 I wish Id have just died back then I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now I have a ton of other people to drag down with meThe latest I think I would be happy if thing has been getting in a relationship I think Im thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes I havent yet made and because I pretty genuinely hate myself Ive pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA I dont really believe in inherent selfworth Im almost 21 now and havent ever been on a date let alone received a nonplatonic hug Nobody ever expresses interest in me I always have to initiate thought Ive found this is usually the case with my friends as well if I dont initiate Id never get invited to anything I cant even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit Its not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to It feels like all the changes Ive made over the years have amounted to nothingIm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time I havent been able to cry in years so I just self harm when I feel like crying Its not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it doesnt give me the rush it used to it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense Besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunkAll my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers It feels like Ive gotten left behind on the road of life Everyone is dating some are already married with people they love I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if Ive started dating yet I keep trying to explain to him that Im trying but not having any luck Whenever dating comes up thats all I ever get Im sure youll find someone eventually Thing is none of the Id might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left I can make since professional and medical help has failedI dont enjoy anything anymore Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores EU4 is too frustrating now Ive already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through I dont enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year I dont have any shows I really enjoy Ive always wanted to learn to draw Im actually a huge fan of furry art but Im pretty bad and Im a perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much cant do it and get betterSuicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better The logic I mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number so Id be better off I used to think Ok Ill wait until I turn 30 and then Ill kill myself if things havent improved However as things have deteriorated Ive moved that up to 25 More recently Ive moved it up to after graduation Im thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself I dont even know how Im going to make it that far Suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something I have to doI dont buy the whole it gets better thing anymore Its been over 3 years It really doesnt in my experience All the medical advice Ive been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself I dont understand to what end though Like if I dont kill myself now then what I get to continue hurting tomorrow The only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum I dont see the appeal in it I think once I do it Ill go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night Nobody would notice Im gone possibly for a few weeks nobody would hear a thing I might not even be found My body can feed some scavengers I dont have to hurt anymore people who love me dont have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins Ive been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up Of course this is still likely a few years away so Im probably not at immediate risk of killing myselfSo thats where Im standing Its 3AM right now and I cant sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again The Zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation Nothing has helped and I dont think I can get better anymoreI have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon I dont know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point What should I do
1	I want to do it but even finding a way to do this is difficult This is the plan that Ive come up with so farWill it work I dont want to stay alive but be disabled I want this to work Where I live its very hard for me to find a way to end my life without causing me too much painHeres what I want to doIll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up Ill overdose on short acting and long acting insulin and Ill take over 1g of propranolol and maybe an antiemetic so I dont vomit the drug Ill stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousnessIm 24 and I am a pharmacy student The place where I live and my social skills  or lack thereof  dont allow me to get my hands on opioids or other ways of dying peacefully Im not here to talk about why I want this I know many of you know the feelingI just dont want to do it and fail and have to face family after that or live with permanent brain damage Please message me if comments are not allowed I hope this is not against the rules
1	I cant go on anymoreIve recently had suffered a psychotic episode first and only one yet and I have hurt the person I cared about the most Life has lost its meaning and I dont see any way things could get better I have no future and cant shake the feeling that it was simply taken from me probably projecting or putting the blame on other because Im a fucking coward and cant take responsibility for my actions I probably deserved it cause Im a shit human and I cant change Too much of a coward to kill myself and I will probably start starving myself soon Dont upvote Sorry for the bad english its a second language

0	Shopping IS AWFUL Finally was allowed to go out to London a place other than trees and forests Ive only been on picnics for 5 monthsAnd I have to say shopping is terrible before you walk in theres these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginningThen the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you also very uncomfortable you cant actually touch any beauty products like perfume etc why would I go shopping if I cant touch or try anything onI had the same experience at every other shop and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask it was not a pleasant experienceI dont think I want to go back to shopping ever again if thats how uncomfortable its going to be I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores the future will be completely online and social distanced and its scaryAnyways I dont think anyone would care enough to read about what I did today but if you did what do you think the future will look like

1	2929Thats the oldest Ive ever been Its the oldest Im ever meant to beI dont remember when I had the first dream It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldnt even be able to remember They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and youre lying in bed wonderingDid I just wake up or just fall asleepThe fragments dont seem to follow a timeline just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out Remembering moments out of a long series of eventsIn these dreams Ive seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timelineIt took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where a friend or family member passes and Im forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments It wasnt until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were As stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family If you believe in that type of thing Ive cousins who experience the same Weve talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didnt understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us29Out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of 29 My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days awayIve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now Before I had ever met my wife I had come to a decision I wasnt going to live past the age of 27 in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday I cant say for certain why I chose 27 Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 except Im far from famous 27 also happens to be my favorite number I could not tell you why Ive always just been drawn to itWhen my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you The plan Id concocted still toiled about in my brain that day But my plans had changed29It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age The limit was always twentynine There are none where Im a proud father watching my children go None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife whos aged so much better than I over the years After 29 they just stopWe fixate on negatives humans that is Its an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives Im far from being a master at this myselfWhy dont I see myself as older than 29 in any of theseIs it because thats when my story ends Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 2017 Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game boardOr is it something more positive Does the familys clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life Is it a gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become Glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through thisMaybe we arent clairvoyant Odds are its just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics Ive already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not geneticsIs it going to end at 29 am I going to see the other side of 30 If I dont is it going to be my own doing Maybe Im not allowed to see how my own story ends not until I experience it first hand so as to not spoil the momentI dont make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation I did at one point but then I accepted that part myself The part that feels knows that suicide is an option I cant say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately Others are turned and inspected whatif situations played out over and overHow would she reactWhat would the funeral look likeHow many dominos would fall if I cast my own down Some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original positionThats the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself My empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs More so if it was selfinflictedIt has always been easy to hurt myself Intentionally hurting others that I care about though has always felt impossible I know Ive caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again So Ive never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planningWithin the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own Im not even sure what to call it desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending Perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself Just the chaos of existenceWith some luck maybe Just maybe 29 isnt the end Its just a new beginning
