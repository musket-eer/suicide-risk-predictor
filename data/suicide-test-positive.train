1	Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteriaI am trapped inside a void  There is absolutely nothing for me  I go through the monotonous tasks of everyday life with nothing to look forward to no aspirations whatsoever  The only saving grace I felt like I had the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted and accepted me for who I am was Maren  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds and shes assured me that it is talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day  It was the one thing that kept me going knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her even if only briefly before we went to sleepShe made me feel accepted  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth  She made me feel like I could actually like myself and be okay with who I was  But most of all she made me feel loved  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely  I felt completely at ease when talking with her  Ive told her things that no one else in the world knows about me and she made me feel like she actually cared about them that she cared about me  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else  We talked about getting together being with each other devising crazy scenarios with how to be together  We talked all the time nothing could keep us apart  Except for Ty  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the breakup with Starr  She talked to me whenever I needed her and she always made me feel better about it  She was my shining star in a pitchblack sky  None of this is any longer thoughWe have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me and I dont blame her  I do nothing but hurt her these days  None of it is intentional but it happens nonetheless  When we first started talking again I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that  I suppose she thought I was overexaggerating but I wasnt  I need to have interaction in my life  I know it is not fair to the people around me and I know that it is not what they want but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time  My thoughts are extremely selfdestructive  I need someone to spend time with someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts  For about four months I was legitimately happy  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy  I was finally over Starr thanks to the help from Maren  I had no stress at all things were actually looking up even my migraines were becoming few and far between  I was in love and I felt loved  If I could go back in time and replay those four months over and over again I would without hesitation  That was the best time of my life  I didnt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control  I didnt have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside  I could share them with Maren and she was incredibly receptive  I didnt have to lie about who I was or leave details out  Maren made me feel like I was a good person  I told her about my past and she seemed genuinely concerned for me  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself  She told me that I was attractive something I had never been told before not even by Starr who I was together with for ten years  I was happy with who I was at that time  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself  But with her we would send each other snapchat pictures and she made me feel like I wasnt the hideous person that I thought myself to be  In hindsight I am sure that she was just being nice to me and that she did not actually think I was attractive  It was still nice to hear it thoughI miss those days  I long for them to return but I know that that will never happen  The same thing has happened with many people before though none to that extreme  They are fine with me when we first start talking and eventually they realise how highmaintenance and fucked up I am  That causes them to drift away until eventually we stop talking altogether or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives  That was the case with Starr  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me  In the morning she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again  After ten years of being together she ended it on a whim and caused me to lose not only my significant other but also my best friend  The same thing is happening with Maren  I am driving her away and eventually I will not have a best friend again  I will be completely alone  The last time I was completely alone right after Starr broke up with me I didnt leave my room for two weeks  I didnt eat a single thing in those two weeks  I laid there in bed staring at my ceiling in the darkness constantly in tears trying to realise where I had gone wrong  I have never cried so much in my life  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life but at that moment I could not contain them any longer  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world and that is how I feel again right nowIt was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again  I have no idea at all how to make friends  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever I was prepared to either be completely ignored or told to go away  That didnt happen though  We had a wonderful conversation reminiscing about our childhood  I dont remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr but I told her everything and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it  She stayed up with me until the morning just talking with me on Facebook  I was in tears for most of that conversation partly because I was still upset about the breakup but also because I couldnt believe that someone actually cared  Especially someone I hadnt talked to in over a decade  When we started to get close and revealed our feelings for one another we joked about how us reconnecting was a red string of fate  I dont believe in fate but I also dont think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment when I felt like I had nothing left  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else  I am incredibly socially awkward I cannot make new friends at all  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety  Online I just have nothing to say  I am a boring person  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits rr4r rkikpals and the like  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice but none of them developed into an actual friendship  They all stopped talking to me after one session  I dont have anything at all to give in a friendshipAfter fighting with Maren and being told that I cant keep badgering her to hang out with me when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend who was her ex my selfworth is absolutely rock bottom  She has made me realise that I am the problem that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship but I see now that it was never her fault  I am just completely unlovable  I can never have more than one true friend  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up I had very few friends and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly every time  Because of this I latch on to the one friend I have  I suffocate them  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more and leave me  I have tried so hard to give her space and not ask her to hang out with me or talk to me but whenever I try I get extremely depressed  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no I get a sinking feeling  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy we did everything together  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something she was happy to hang out with me  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me  I have very little to offer it was mainly her driving everything and that must have been exhaustingI am getting tired of writing though  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them  I have lived with them my entire life and not a single person has stayed around because of them  I am writing this because I now have zero friends  I am completely alone  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth or faded into oblivionGoodbyeSteven

1	Anyone planning suicide in the longterm futureIm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe 45 yearsWhy do I want to kill myselfIts kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Familyalong with a lack of purpose or inherent value of lifeEconomicGrowing up was hard and Ive had to overcome a lot of adversity lowerincome household mother dying ata young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people hereIm in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenialMy parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different schoolor even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campusthat I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didnt have a good sense of directionor idea for a majorcareer and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didnt have the resources or finances firstgeneration college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academicallybut since my majordepartment is kinda shitty applied math Im worried that I wont get a good paying job unlikeengineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave collegenext year with about 2528K in loansFamilyGenerally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the houseas fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becomingselfsufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though hes pretty oldand should be focusing on retirement I havent come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of itnot super religous but super conservative strict and familyoriented My parents are also immigrants so we dont havetons of wealthy family hereHealthI have a lot of chronic probably geneticallycaused health diseases since I was youngWhen I was young and in my midteens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportiveAfter my mom died my dad didnt bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialistsanymore my health has decreased Its hard at college too because I dont have a car and I didnt always havehealth insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These arentlifethreatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and selfconsciousSo because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I dont want to kill myself yet but in 34 yearswhen I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicideplanning once Im in the real worldIve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending evenIt seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a firstgeneration college student background with severlylimited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even 5 years And itshard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and uppermiddle class families succeed in life when its aconstant struggle for meAnd even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery whats the point Why suffer andstruggle so much in life if I dont really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreedwith me and is truly planning suicide in the futureIm also fine with talking to people about my choices andorexpanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mindTLDR Want to wait 34 years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living ifIm economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complexreasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and dont see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living

1	2929Thats the oldest Ive ever been Its the oldest Im ever meant to beI dont remember when I had the first dream It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldnt even be able to remember They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and youre lying in bed wonderingDid I just wake up or just fall asleepThe fragments dont seem to follow a timeline just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out Remembering moments out of a long series of eventsIn these dreams Ive seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timelineIt took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where a friend or family member passes and Im forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments It wasnt until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were As stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family If you believe in that type of thing Ive cousins who experience the same Weve talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didnt understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us29Out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of 29 My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days awayIve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now Before I had ever met my wife I had come to a decision I wasnt going to live past the age of 27 in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday I cant say for certain why I chose 27 Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 except Im far from famous 27 also happens to be my favorite number I could not tell you why Ive always just been drawn to itWhen my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you The plan Id concocted still toiled about in my brain that day But my plans had changed29It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age The limit was always twentynine There are none where Im a proud father watching my children go None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife whos aged so much better than I over the years After 29 they just stopWe fixate on negatives humans that is Its an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives Im far from being a master at this myselfWhy dont I see myself as older than 29 in any of theseIs it because thats when my story ends Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 2017 Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game boardOr is it something more positive Does the familys clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life Is it a gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become Glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through thisMaybe we arent clairvoyant Odds are its just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics Ive already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not geneticsIs it going to end at 29 am I going to see the other side of 30 If I dont is it going to be my own doing Maybe Im not allowed to see how my own story ends not until I experience it first hand so as to not spoil the momentI dont make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation I did at one point but then I accepted that part myself The part that feels knows that suicide is an option I cant say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately Others are turned and inspected whatif situations played out over and overHow would she reactWhat would the funeral look likeHow many dominos would fall if I cast my own down Some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original positionThats the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself My empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs More so if it was selfinflictedIt has always been easy to hurt myself Intentionally hurting others that I care about though has always felt impossible I know Ive caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again So Ive never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planningWithin the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own Im not even sure what to call it desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending Perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself Just the chaos of existenceWith some luck maybe Just maybe 29 isnt the end Its just a new beginning

0	Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black castpresence Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and televisionJust a disclaimer I am African American Im sharing an observation and this isnt an invitation for a racist discussion2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proudObviously companies see these protests and come out in support and thats fine But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversityI was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students And many other commercials that you wouldnt usually see a black face onThis is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race Ive never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform Maybe Im reading too far into it but its just what I noticed on television Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress Its upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when its convenient to show that you support an agenda

0	Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child I know this isnt really a thing to complain about but ive always wondered if anyone else felt the sameI wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience By the time I was needing to be schooled my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didnt have the capacity to give me very much attention By the time I was able to read well on my own my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row or took too long to figure out easy stuff Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether From that point on almost everything I did was on my own I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether It wasnt just with studying I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion Because of this I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house not making any trouble whatsoever Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance withI had fun by myself in those times Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find I played them Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimumA decade down the line im now older and in high school I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time Ive also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficultNow im 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I must always be perfect and never cause a problem Ive worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me downI feel really down all the time now I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy The good boy in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along but its harder and harder to do that every passing day I just feel depressed I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them Sorry mom but your 3rd child has a problem Also I dont even know if theyll careAnd looking back on this whole situation I feel like I have only myself to blame I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I couldIm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do Does anyone else feel the same

0	Despite what we will tell you Californians do have an accent Mine is basically standard American but thats cuz I was basically forced into a standard American accent cuz my family would correct me if I spoke in anything but that so my accent is distinct from most people around me although thats relatively common but most peoples accent where I live sounds like if a NorCal accent had a slight southern drawl and had the speed and stressing of a valley gurl accent its bazaar and so easy to understand although the people that stray more towards the valley gurl side are a bit harder to understand I do still have a central California accent but its not nearly as thick as most peoples they didnt completely beat not literally it out of me

1	I just want her backMe and my ex girlfriend had been going out for over a year I loved her more than anything and to be honest I still do She was my whole life we did everything together we went out pretty much every night and every weekend She was my only friendWe broke up because she constantly lied to me she didnt show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself She didnt come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her friend who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugsIt got to the point where on the night I broke with her I flipped a coin if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself Thankfully it was heads but Im getting back to that stage again At school I have no friends anymore when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at meI cant even try to be friends with my ex because she cant even look at me and she wont tell me why Its eating me up I cant live like this anymore I just want to wrap my arms around her and never let go She is so intelligent and beautiful She is the most amazing girl I have ever met Now she has started to walk around with the friend who I mentioned before that friend made my life hell for months she is the reason why I have cut myself on many occasions she also told her My ex to kill herself constantly to the point where she was about to I just want her back I cant live without her anymore If she doesnt even say hello to me by next Friday Im just going to go and hang myself because I cant take it anymore

1	My life is falling apartHi all This is my first and maybe last post on here Ive had a pretty easy life I went to good schools I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much I worked in Canary Wharf  UK Version of Wall Street  as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage I have a group of friends who are always there for each other my friends are my second family We always have each others backs My life should be perfect ya know Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him Then it changedA few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mothers Day and just didnt see them I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist They died a week later in hospital In a few weeks after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such which was pretty much everything I had My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact Im going to prison for 2 years Shes also leaving me for a guy she works with turns out theyve been having an affair since early December and he sexually assaulted her Apparently Im just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart My mum cries most morning and nights over it Ive always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life I feel like Ive let people down my entire life I wish I could be someone different My brother for example He is a national swimmer he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry My parents were always so proud of him Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me They found out I smoked in year 9 I was never part of a sports team in school I wasnt popular They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had So basically Ive decided to end it My entire life Ive let people down disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me Ive lost my friends my girlfriend my company and soon Im going to lose my freedom I had everything and now I have nothing I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me Now its just me Alone in the dark lying in bed at 142am on a Tuesday morning Im not sure when Ill go through with it maybe a few days maybe a few weeks or maybe when Im in prison So long reddit

1	Lets be realThe only reason suicide is frowned upon and shown as taking the easy way out is because governing bodies dont want to lose the revenue you will create with your taxes and contribution to society
1	Dont scroll and read this because is for YOUIf youre reading this right now I want you to feel proud of yourself because with all this b going on with all the people that hate on you with all the drama and all the craziness that goes on in this world Youre still living still breathing and youre still killing it and most importantly youre still trying theyre still trying to understand this whole world thing and youre not giving up so easy To give up and it takes a really strong person not to give up if youre reading right now I want you to know that things are going to fall into place Youre going to find out who you are Youre going to meet the love of your life Youre going to find amazing friends who support you are going to find a career choice that you love and you are going to be happy and youre going to find peace in yourself and in case nobodys told you over the last year or so you are amazing and I am so proud of you for not giving up So keep pushing and keep trying because one day youre going to get the life that you deserve
1	Lied my way out of the psych wardSo a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt Someone said I should and I decided to do it I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday I was telling them that I felt better when in reality I still feel like killing myself I just didnt want to be in there anymore because the doctor didnt give a shit I told him that I wasnt feeling good when he asked how I was doing and he said If I went to the grocery store and asked how the clerk was doing I expect them to say good because thats the polite thing to do I dont want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing which made no fucking sense because its not a grocery store its a fucking psych ward Im supposed to be honest with how I am feeling After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life He clearly didnt give a fuck I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I dont know what to do Any help would be greatly appreciated

1	Suicide is not an option for me Thats not just a tired saying its my reality But if its the only thing I can think about where do I go from hereI crossposted from rdepression Im sorry if you see this twice Ive been lurking here on my main for a long time and I dont know that I fit in Im sorry if my situation isnt relatable It sounds really stupidI have a great life I know many people are alone but Im not no matter how much I keep trying to be I try to push my friends and family away but I cant I had a pretty traumatic childhood but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazingSuicide is absolutely not an option for me I have too many people who care about me I know I know how this sounds Once my dad and grandma pass away then its very much on the table  friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it However my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy Ive got a couple decades before that becomes a reality Sometimes I resent that and thats the darkest thought Ive ever had Ive never told anyone this before but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad  my favorite person in the world  is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too and I really dont want toIm also gainfully employed in a job I used to love and really should still love Im not wealthy but I can support myself My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people my boss is a good person I believe in the work and it pays the bills even in my very expensive cityI have friends and the ability to have more friends but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people awayI just dont know where to go from here I feel like I have to keep it all up  working being a normal person or faking it as best as possible I isolate myself a lot I never go out but still my friends are there Its very weird and confusing I dont know how I got so lucky Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them but theyre all very cool people  theyre intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives I dont know how Ive tricked all these people into being my friends or how Ive tricked my job into keeping me employed or how Ive tricked my family into being so supportive But I have and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyoneI dont want to be alive anymore Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks Every time Im alone and Im alone a lot all the same But I dont know what to do I feel so fucking trapped But my amazing supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this  and theyd probably have me committed Theyd probably try to make me quit my stressful job as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job which is stressful yeah but a mentally healthy person could handle this  hell even a slightlymorehealthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it Then Id have nowhere to go nothing to do My friends and family would get tired of me and Id be in the same situation as so many people who are aloneIts like Ive got it backwards I have no reason to be depressed right now but I am cripplingly so But if I tell anyone my life will be turned upside down and Ill have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12I just dont know where to go from here Im sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow And Im sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging  I dont understand why Ive gotten so unfairly lucky in life either I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me I know that sounds awful

1	Dont think I was meant to be a mom maybe Ill kill myself insteadSince having my baby in January Ive been increasingly depressed angry and anxious I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest I dont care WHAT it is All I know is I want it to stop I dont enjoy being a mother I got pregnant at 19 Just recently had my 21st bday So Im a young mom I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom Ive worked at daycares Ive always been good w kids I always wanted to be a mother And I LOVE my baby with all my heart but Im just not a good mom I hate not being able to do anything anymore Always broke Cant even shit on my own time I dont sleep My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night I dont like my appearance I dont like sitting home all day I dont like the sound of my baby crying I dont like changing 10000 diapers a day I dont like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to I miss independence Freedom Having a personality other than tired and stressed Friends Going out Relaxing Having goals and hopes for my future Lmao all the goals I had are gone now Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter Cant get a good job without college Etc etc etc Ill amount to nothing more than a mother now And for some people thats enough But I feel like I may as well be 50 already just say bye to any semblance of youth i have I dont think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here I dont think its fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option Cant undo my baby in my brain But I will never be happy doing this either I just want to quit I want to die I want her to have a better mom I want her to not see anger from her mother I want to not be conscious or aware anymore I want to cease to be But Im terrified Ill do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death Id have done it long before now And Ive struggled w depression bi polar borderline personality my whole life I dont see it getting better Just worse So why stick around

0	Day 5 of posting things related to the Internațional Waffles DayGoogle must be confused about why I searched for this every day Waffle Day has recently begun to be celebrated in other countries as well often ushered in by restaurants and cafés specialising in waffles as in India where the Belgian Waffle Co in 2018 declared that they would celebrate National Waffle Day in July or in Norway where Waffle Day was all but unknown until producers of waffle irons milk and flour started to promote waffle day in the mid2010s In the United States National Waffle Day is celebrated in August to commemorate the date of a US patent on a waffle iron however the celebration is described as at best a bizarre or unique holiday  the fluff stuff of radio DJ commentary a frequent criticism of food celebration days Some people love the occasion and think of it as a real festival whereas others dont really like or understand it

1	Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI havent made a post like this before but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such Right now Im not doing well and Im in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that wont scare and worry my friends and familyIve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis one month ago My post isnt a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump aroundMy now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night Now Some of my best friends got married  this week where my ex was the maid of honor I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day  many advise no on the friends with the ex especially in this situation but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner and just want my friendship that I havehad with her to remain I dont have many friends left around me The night before their wedding I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didnt say much more than that My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of BiPolar disorder They dont understand it and Dont believe I am and think Im chasing something that doesnt exists  The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to But I wasnt able toI feel so guilty and ashamed of myself but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do And told her I dont think being friends will ever work I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding My friends and fraternity brothers All this is too much for me right now with the added fact Ive changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I dont find meaningful or fulfilling And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole I know now that its a problem I need to work onIve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little I dont know how they feel but I can imagine it hurts is frustrating and an annoyance they didnt need I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself That it would magnify the pain Im feeling and put it on to them Im just so unstable right now even on medication therapy and exercise I know I can reach out to my friends for support and dont want to burden them Im just so afraid and lonely right now I dont want to die but death is looking more and more favorable I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away To anyone that reads this thank you

1	Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right subreddit to post it to I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow Apologies for the long postI had started working at a company where I 30M met K 30M We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay Now he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay In fact he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person FurthermorehHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows He has his personal issues why he doesnt want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades However I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on gettingHonestly when he first told me about his secret I tried my best to be laid back about it I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend Admittedly I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting love you or xx I guess from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends However I naively saw nothing wrong in that Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him Because of this we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with Whilst I enjoy his company many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoidingHe is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem On one hand I wish to keep him in my life but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friendI honestly do not know what to do Did I do something wrongAny helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated ThanksTLDR Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is threatening to commit suicide

1	End of week twoToday marks the end of the second week in quarantine Ive been working from home and I almost never leave my tiny living space Im here 247 completely alone I dont think anyone would care if I died I know my mom would but everyone else would forget after a week I have no purpose I have no reason to wake up tomorrow Theres nothing happening tomorrow that I need to be here for Same for the day after that and the day after that I just wake up and work for eight hours Then I sit there not knowing what to do with myself I used to be able to think about killing myself and it brought me a lot of comfort But now Im new meds and theyre working I cant think about death anymore Which I know is supposed to be good but I feel like I lost my only real coping mechanism I always felt that no matter how bad things got no matter how much pain I was in I could always kill myself And I sort of feel like I lost that comforting thought I just dont see any reason to be here I dont want to be here

1	Waking up in the middle of the night weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay aliveIts currently Monday morning 330AM I woke up about two hours ago still half drunk having had about 3 hours sleep ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed I spent most of this weekend in my bed I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to I have a good support network which Im extremely grateful The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13 Im now 27 M Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then In this time I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity This adds to my conflict Do I want to be here Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it  My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career During the pandemic and recession the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances I am one of these people I am very grateful for what has been provided to me but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new jobampx200BRight now I kind of just wish I hadnt woken up in the middle of the night I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing Love of any kind seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me left or died I know that Im the common link here I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because Im mentally ill but how the fuck do I fix all this I couldnt deal with another loved one dying from drugalcohol overdose or suicide I cant count them on both hands anymore I know there are people in much worse positions but I cant talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone Today was a nice day why am I still like this Its almost 4am now I wonder if Ill be able to go back to sleep

1	I have GOT to stop this damn rollercoaster one way or another Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable eventsI feel as though there is at this point no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions Sometimes I have a hard time hearing people and Ill just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours Also while in this state I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation Usually other people are completely confused unhelpful or downright mean and mocking It feels as if some people never left elementary schoolI have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers This makes the fluctuation between ability to focuslisten for understanding and distractionanxiety even more frustrating and unpredictableSome backstory Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied can lie do lie to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence a balance everyone sits somewhere on It is the latter desire to hoard precious objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and Gaslighting that has planted the seed of first my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and second the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science and CLEARLY religion are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter Im sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but Im starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of coincidence For example I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads I need a Job and clothes I clearly incredibly insensitively joke to the girl by saying Hey yea buddy I need those too Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly You dont need it We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the synchronicityThese things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way I was not raised religious in any way and in fact was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticismI am very serious I NEED to know exactly what you believe and WHY The why preferably would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me and undoubtedly more redditors to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisisMuch love for you all I look forward to your excellent powers of deduction Yes I am in a humorous mood this is not always the case and my emotions can become so acutely anxious that I really dont want to ever feel that specific pain again

1	Dear reddit after taking a look at my life I realized that I have noone to talk toand that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that there are none who are willing to offer itI have nobody not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my moodSpeaking of moods Im in a fairly dangerous one Not for others mind you I dont believe in harming other people for no good reason My mood is hazardous to my own healthMost days Im suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain Today I find myself quite lacking in caution selfpreservation instinct and the ability to care whether or not I live or dieOn top of all this I have work in about 1 12 hours and Im not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularlyEDIT Oh right lest we forget the biggest reason I cant talk to anyone is because theyre all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems especially if I decide to stick around Its a crappy loop that screws me over time
1	To whoever is thinking about suicide and sees thisEven if it feels you are alone that no one understands you that you are so worthless to the point that the world is better off without you Just stop And think clearly about what you are doing There are many people that would be sad to see you go like that Even if you dont know that One of your family or friends pets some complet stranger that you accidentally smiled to and helped them relive their stress or even one of your fellow redditors that are kind enough to care about you I know i do Even though i never knew you Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point Well just make sure to think about everyone that would love to help you before you do anything you might not live to regret Please

1	Hi im new to hereIdk how to usenice to meet you all
1	For everyone who came here looking for helpThis is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days yes we all know one of THOSE days Its a hard outlook on life but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better I post this in hopes to help you Its very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me so I did my best And Best of luck to you all I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth you can make it through this just as I did Because you start seeing things as no overall point If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking risks and with risks comes reward You wont even notice it at first But it will be thereI would have to say to one guy just one guy there is no point No point None I simply dont see how you can disagree you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details you cant I dare you to try I dare you to tempt fate Its simply put at that there is no point Its all just there you cant put it together you cant write it out because if you were to try there would be no point Do you get where Im headed Of course you dont Because Im headed no where because there is no point It has been shown over and over again in every way possible people are just to blind to see that they put words to it to try and make sense But yet there is none No sense There is nothing this world wouldnt give to fill it with sense To give it a point There is no knowledge there is none How can you possibly say you know when you yourself havent known before Can you just simply believe it because they tell you so There is no knowing there is no point Ill try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon and believe it to be real Its trial and error guess and check nothing else There is no point So how can we all decide what to put behind this When you yourselves dont knowIs there such a thing as success or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope turned into our reality How do you know  How do you know Take it to yourself to think Has the hope and thought of success become something the one thing that we all humans agree upon Letters and numbers Its all just how we put together the everything the everything of nothing There is no point We simply must agree that there is no such idea How many times must it be shown to us that there is no point There is a such thing as nothing and it is everything that we see Just what we have agreed upon makes it something Why cant we allow the thought of being unhappy What makes it unhappy and to whom Does that really justify what can make one happy or not Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being unhappy that we seek happiness But can it really be sought How can you deny something to not be right when it never leaves you It never leaves you it will always appear and come upon us So can we embrace it cant we all just let it happen Why do we continue to escape it when all it does is return harsher as if it were angry at us We have left it for too long I have left it for too long I will not change I will not cheer I will not forget that it is here Its inside us The only thing you have to do is look deep enough When faced with the chance to escape it I will just as we all would but I will not forget I will allow it to come back upon me I will surrender to it Maybe just maybe it wont forgive me Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be unhappy I probably wont call it this for very much longer because its not really being unhappy its more of human nature We have grown out of ourselves we have become distant with our nature our true meaning and being the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it We are just here and we cant accept it now Its been too long why oh why cant the people just see We arent here for a reason we just are it happened so what Live with it there is no need to find this out so there is no need to find anything else Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you happy Its more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding We will never know so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far  This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day because does it really matter Does it Back to being a toy We are all one we have no right to do otherwise we need to find what we can do and do it No questions Dont think about what you do Just do it If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it But what you are doing is what you must Because that is what we have given the title happiness What we are made to do individually But its simply beyond that the concept is made up Its just to keep us in our places but we have made it be for so long well that happiness has become something and with anything that is something there is always the opposite We made an opposite to nothing something that isnt there So how can we break from this cycle Well just remember No feelings Do what you are meant to do We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is And follow it but once feelings get involved you need to drop it and think again Its something that must be done In order to break the cycle Of which we have named Depression and happiness
1	I need to talk to someone right nowI drove for 3 hours with no destination in mind because I was trying to clear my mind from suicidal thoughts Prior that I sobbed for an hour in front of a church and I feel like I couldnt take it anymore I even thought of crashing the car intentionally I am not at my best state at the moment and everyone I know is busy

1	Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and its not bound to get any betterThe past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time thats passed Ive experienced the following   Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did theyd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where Ive been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didnt graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neckdeep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I dont even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just dont want to deal with it anymore  Im just so tired and I cant see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I wont have to see them because it always ends the same way  with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I dont have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like Ive regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring  I think Im at my breaking point I dont know what to do and I dont want to tolerate this anymore I know Im on the younger end of the spectrum and theres the unknown thats waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just dont want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day

1	I know what is after life and I want itI had an NDE in 2009 after an ATV accident and I remember the afterlife It was so beautiful No pain complete and utter peacefor lack of a better termMy  Life is similar to a vacation where youre staying at an acquaintances house and they tell you make yourself at homeBut youre still a bit uneasy and you still tip toe around because you know you cant get too comfortable and no matter how many accommodations they can provide you know that It Is Not Your HomeIt never will be I will be going back home this Friday the 22nd I already have a place timeand plan Thank you all for your encouraging words and support

1	Its All My FaultNo it isntYes it isIm in a strange emotional state right now I dont know how I should be starting my story  I dont know what Im supposed to say But Ill try to make it as clear as possibleMy house has never been one to display much affection Thats not to say we dont love each other or someone is overtly abusive but emotions are not shown very often do I care too much or maybe I dont care at all and Im faking it As a result communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here parents were refugees from Viet NamMy father never graduated high school He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church All his life he has done manual labor of some sort and currently works as a mechanic at a selfowned although beginning to fail mechanic shop Despite all this he will never ever pass by an opportunity to help someone whether it is through money work or otherwise In my eyes he is practically a saint despite some minor flaws gambling which he has fixed and a little bit of drinking This is because no matter what he will help and expect nothin in return He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face even though it may end up costing him Throughout my childhood he was and still is working six days a week from 7AM to 7PM at the shop and sometimes even as late as 9PM He works all day and he works hard even though the business is meager he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home Because he worked so much I could never see him  often and as a child I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect but I never quite knew why Of course now that I have grown older 19 I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up I love him more than words can explain for it and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer Dont get me wrong hes still healthy and alive but I just wish I could get closer to him but I dont know how At all And it kills meMy mother was one of the boat people that fled Viet Nam leaving her parents when she was only 15 At only a week out to sea however her boat was caught up by a Chinese Hong Kong patrol boat and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong Thankfully because this was towards t he end of the conflict they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America due to political asylum or something I cant recall When she arrived living with her auntuncle who were already here at the time her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school After that she perservered and went on despite having limited English skills to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist Again my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people even if it costs her as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives However she has a quick temper And I mean quick On one hand I guess you could say Im closer to my mom than my dad since she had more education so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general but on the other I just felt that there was always a kind of barrier between us as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didnt have with my momI know this is getting long and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly I just want to note that at this point I have mostly calmed down and my thoughts are getting more lucid However I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out Furthermore the nature of my issue is something that has and probably will recur constantly so while I am in control of my thoughts I figure pre is better than postAs you can see from my descriptions I hold both of my parents in very high regards to the point where when I was younger and to a certain extent even now I could see them do no wrong Growing up everything I did I did it to make them happy to please them to constnatly seek their approval And even now I see nothing wrong with that especially when I consider that everything I have now is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide And I am truly eternally  grateful I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children providing them with the same albeit unspoken love and care that my parents have shown me I have learned so much as a person from each of them the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father and the necessity of knowledge determination and respect from my mother Again I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid However this is where the problem beginsEven at a young age if my parents ever fought each other or got mad at me or my brother regardless of fault I would blame myself I would not tell them I blamed myself but in my heart I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault And thus I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting themThis worked fine until Id say starting about 5 or 6 years ago when family issues began cropping upAs I mentioned earlier my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect My dad is very quiet and softspoken and often will take t he blame in order to diffuse any situation For that respect him immensely Seriously His ability to maintain composure was astounding When my brother began to reach that age where everything and everyone is out to get you a lot of fights broke out in the family because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and americanized my brother was becoming Needless to say fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure but of course blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together As I said earlier from my dad I developed a kind of do everything I can mentality towards my family I refused to become a broken statistic The fights grew in number and volume my brother became more rebellious my father began getting tired etc etcFast forward to the present I know this is getting long and to be honest everytime I write something I realize I have more to write but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heardContinued in comments due to length

1	Not really suicidal just depressedFor a while a couple of years I have been getting more and more depressed However Im very good at hiding it so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is Actually thats not true My life is great compared to a lot of people my family rocks I have a decent amount of money Im in college and good friends But there is one thing that has been missing from my life a relationship Im basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl Im 20 now and its awkward to admit I have a girl I kind of like who I work with but shes from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopesI really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am but I dont want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist They have enough worries without worrying about me I know they would give me all the help in the world but I just cant bring myself to telling them about it Every time my Mom randomly asks Are you OK I think for a second to say no and tell her everything But instead I smile say Of course Mom and move on with my lifeAnyways I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this

1	I thought I was ready to kill myselfI had a hot bath I cut my left wrist and was planning to just bleed out i thought it was pretty aesthetic how the water started to look and how the blood was flowing from my wrists I started to feel scared very scared Im an atheist and I accept that there is nothing after we die but coming so close to it made me scared Or maybe Im just a pussy or going out hannah baker style isnt how I want to goI think ill make a bucket list before I die Theres a few things I want to do before I die Ive never eaten a steak before I think Ill try that I did check off one thing from my bucket list today now that I think about it I think Ill revisit some old memories from when I was a kid the area isnt far from me Im good looking funny confident great hair great voice i have women i have money but Im not happy My entire personality feels empty I just emulate whatever character Ive seen before for whatever suits the situation I dont really feel like a person When im not trying to emulate anyone all I really am is just angry edgy unfunny blunt and above all just stubborn My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering my suffering has always been my own faultI realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me it will always hurt and I just cant seem to forget My wrists really hurt im in no danger of dying anymore Im just dizzy and want water Maybe I dont even want to die if i truly dead I wouldnt be alive right now Or perhaps its the natural instinct to survive thats restricting me
1	When Will It EndI am so tired of waking up and feeling so empty and lonely Some days I just wonder what I did to deserve this life I pray for God to come and take me everyday I cant even see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore just more loneliness and pain Just more days spent crying in bed holding sheets to my mouth to muffle the sounds of pure agony and sadnessIm sick of being in pain I hope for happiness but wonder if I even deserve a happy ending anymoreI find myself often searching for the purpose that God put me on this earth for I love to make others feel happy and cared for because I would hate for anyone else to feel the way I do every single dayI dont know how much longer I can do this

1	I want to die honorableI dont know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious While I know I would never harm myself willingly I yet desire to cease existing   But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave  And in case I dont die from that then great But I doubt it because I am not good I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I dont regret having to go there But yet perhaps that would make it up for this I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway right So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup   Because else I am just a burden and nonloved by anyone I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well I am the kind of person that depends on others I have to push myself and if I cant go on I just feel horrible  For years I have tried following my dreams actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed Sure I tried and did my best there is nothing more I can do But this is exactly what bothers me If my best isnt enough to continue what else can I do You dont wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible  And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands Be it job and career or love life   Sure I have friends and family I have a roof over my head and food on the plate   But life is more than just surviving especially in these times where society expects much more of someone  I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now But the more days pass the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die  Today it pushed me on the edge I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years To think I really be pushed that hard  But I dont know why for some reason I still do have hope I kinda always have hope for something I cannot explain this phenomenon Even if I think I plan to die in battle I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively Even in such negativity I find positivity But this all is a doubleedged sword the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other the side that just wants me to die  Does anyone else feel like this Can you understand this  And yes I am already trying to get help but I will not know the outcome in the end of all this

0	the republican partys response to the pandemic can be summarized in one sentence if we help people now the democrats will want to help people later just to be clear i aint sayin nothin bout individual republicans the vast majority of republicans are good people but republican elected officials tend to be shitty people obviously not all of them tho the mayor of my city is a republican and so far were only 2 months in hes doing a wonderful job we had no reason to think he would be a good mayor and we shouldnt have elected him but im glad we did so far seriously idk how he got elected this is a very liberal city and he was our fucking police chief and a bad one at that

1	fuck it im over this shitI Thought losing weight would make things better I just need abs and Ill be happy I still look in the mirror and see the fat kid who shoved bags of Doritos into his mouth daily I Thought going to college and having fresh faces and a fresh start would stop the feelings deep down It didnt Thought finding a girl to be happy with would make me happy It didnt Thought starving myself to finally make my body how I always wanted it to look would help make me feel better in the long run It didnt Everyday I wake up wishing I hadnt I still get out of bed and try every day though Some days are better than others Today was amazing Spent the entire day with a beautiful girl Her laugh and smile made me laugh and smile Yet here I am at 1am with suicidal thoughts I fight a losing  battle every fucking day man Things arent getting any easier Ive realized I have no passions No hobbies No real drive for anything in life I feel so lost everyday I dont know how much longer I can hold out honestly The only reason I havent jumped off a building yet is because it would ruin my family I love my little sisters and I know how much it would impact their lives to attend the funeral of their big brother Guys your big brother is trying I really am I just want to be happy but every day is somehow worse than the last Im sick of picking myself up just to be knocked down again Fuck this cycle If anyone ever ends up reading this  know I did it because I woke up one day and wasnt strong enough Im sorry dont blame anyone but me

1	Piling up I have severe depression and aspergers I am 23 Im gay I cannot relate to people outside of a very small group of people and part of how I learned to relate to others is through drugs I am on and off but dont really associate with my old friends who still use heavily pretty often When I do I feel welcome though and not judged so long as Im getting high with them I dont have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure Ive learned to surround myself with people who wouldnt judge or criticize me even for my own good I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didnt want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway Ive wanted to die for more than 13 years Im really really tired The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating As much as its the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy I work retail I will never afford an education Taking loans is suicide anyway  I hate myself and Im fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist I am going to kill myself eventually because I cant possibly live in the us being who I am Escapism was really the last thing I had left Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy I wont ever stop hurting and I dont have a life outside of feeling that pain anymore

1	I dont really like my therapistI know therapist are supposed to help you challenge things about yourself or tell you things you dont want to hear We almost got into an argument my last sessionI dont feel comfortable sharing my suicidal thoughts with anyone except warmlinesHer tough love approach comes off as bitchy to meI know it is important to challenge our perception and we never know anything for certainI honestly think at some point I know when someone is being condescending towards me No one directly says it I read tone actions and body language Sure there are million reasons someones body language may seem condescending but that doesnt negate my opinionSometimes I feel like she doesnt respect my opinion or is too rational

0	Guys Im writing a romance novel Hows the first draft Its just the first page and could probably use some work but its pretty good imo ampx200BShe sauntered into the room her enormous breasts swaying from sidetoside like a great grandfather clock glistening enticingly her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday eveningThe throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a highpitched grown A dog whistle of sorts A siren call that made my 18inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog houseI stumbled over to her my massive shaft swaying from sidetoside rocking the whole house with it Upon closer inspection her giant conkers were even more impressive that Id first thought Sprinkled lightly with freckles like a perfectly peppered biscuit she had the most beautiful bongos Id ever gazed uponI let out a primal yell and immediately entered her causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust We were still clothed Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory This wasnt my first sexual encounter Ive had sex with at least 9 other women Still something about this one was specialStill inside her I could feel her ovaries trembling My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot now spurting from her mouth as if a great cumfountain You like that bebe I grumbledHer nipples gazed at me with lust and thirstI spent the rest of the afternoon tenderizing her meat oven with my man hook

1	Ive day dreamed of killing myself since I was a childNo throwaway nothing like that Ive tried describing this feeling to my parents but even with history of trauma I grew up in not the best house hold No father mother working two jobs brothers and sisters all much older My oldest brother has almost a 20 year age difference on meAnyways I dont know why Its something Ive tried to be vocal about but I find that in modern days those who want to help are far more fucking annoying than those who will just have a logical conversation with ideas opinions facts thoughts to be shared Im not going to kill myself this second nor do I plan on it But I do often day dream of killing myself how itd affect others And more recently the past year or so after experimentation with pot women and living I really got a new perspective I was no longer that basement dwelling kid who played video games all day but instead Id smoke bang hot chicks and have friends Well thats how everyone wants me to live my life but I dont and I cant be happy doing what I used to do I find that more often than not as of recent Ive wanted to kill myself not for the harm and sadness itd cause others but more because I can no longer take othersIts not easy communicating with people who dont understand arent too bright or just generally dont even process your information even when they seem to be hearing the words youre saying My family its not very easy a lot of addicts but not junkies worse Functioning middle class addicts The happy glow on the outside quickly becomes the regular fighting pill popping and drinking Im at a point where theres nothing here left for me Im still youngish 18 But Ive lived a pretty eventful life Ive had a lot of amazing opportunities to work with people I looked at as celebrities On YouTube due to my work in Graphic Design Animation and entertainment Ive had thousands of hours of laughs and smiles and perhaps just as many in the real world as I did the online worldI dont suppose theres a point to any of this but I feel like I wanted to just tell somebody I have a female friend in another state weve known each other for many years now and I dont know I want to tell her I love her but I dont I dont love her she likes me a lot but to me shes the only person I have mentallyintellectually I cant converse or discuss anything with anyone else seemingly I had a bad break up like half a year back and I was happy before that I think and before the girl I broke up with I dont know my point is I know I dont love the first girl my friend so I instead went and hugged my mother and told her I loved her and she gave me a groan and a pissy face unlike normal normal meaning the other 4 times Ive gone up to my mom in that manner hugged her and told her I loved her in the past year I know its just because of her current situation having to go down to my sisters house to wash clothes and my brother getting on her nerves ugh I used to love the kid seriously But I cant stand the fucking sight of my own brother anymore I think Im gonna leave soon not leave leave But I need some space I want to delete this all of this just as I have many posts similar in the past But Im just going to see what happens and if anyone of you can help can explain to me whats going on this fucking skull because it feels like a process is using all of my brains CPU and Im fucking overworked and overloaded but I fucking do nothing all day besidAwzsedX 
1	GuiltyFor context I have a scat fetish dont judge please I didnt choose to have it          A while ago when I was like 17 I was at a gathering and watched a high school girl go upstairs where I knew the bathroom door didnt shut all the way Knowing this I went upstairs after them and hid in a bedroom trying to hear them use the bathroom I honestly dont remember what happened after that but I think I thought about intentionally walking in on them I dont remember them leaving the bathroom and  im pretty sure i didnt even hear anything but I feel like I violated their privacy I feel super guilty about this and have been agonizing over it for weeks I feel like this is the furthest extent of my fetish and that it took over in my head and overruled my moral judgement I think of myself as no better than a rapist or something because of this even though I know its irrational I cant get over this I also have depression and OCD

0	One of the most satisfying things is seeing a genuine feminist Its so nice to see a feminist who believes everyone is equal but doesnt think all men are racists and bad I mean I know there are lots of good feminist but all the ones you see in the front pages of social media seem to be saying that all men are nasty rapists who only think about sex It just annoys me so much when you see the bad feminists that think women are superior like the people on rthefairersex  I just want to say if you are a person who believes in gender equality which is most people I think you are a good person

1	Want to be done with the pain but dont want to hurt others and I fear what does  doesnt come nextThe title is pretty self explanatory I have a life that on the outside looks good Good job Good family etc however it is like a piece of wood that has rotted on the inside and is infested with maggots and termites I have been battling depression and anxiety for years now I have pissed away a lot of money to make myself happy but they are only momentary reprieves Honestly I just want to drive my car to a very wooded and secluded area take a walk down a long path Leave said path and find a beautiful spot and put my pistol to my temple and blow my brains out Suicide notes and all in my pocket or in my car However I dont want to hurt my family friends and so and so forth My best friend committed alcohol induced suicide 4 years ago this past St Paddys Day And it devastated his family and his friends and I had to be the barer of bad news to a lot of people because his family couldnt do it right away I just cant do that to my family even though they are a large part of my stress and depression My friends arent for the most part I mean I just want this to be over But I also am afraid of what comes or doesnt come next and if I am doomed to a worse fate So for now I wont pull the proverbial and literal trigger But man I want to

1	Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time But time changed as I got older I woke up when I was around 12 years old It was all about girls education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since Im 21 btw I was always the clown who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside But inside I was crying I felt alone and unhappy I had friends and a bestfriend yes But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone  I have missed out on so many epic parties I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies As I went to highschool it got worse I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties I was still the funny guy though but that was all During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before I just laughed with them But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced The normal social life always spending time with the guys going out and hooking girls After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my lifeNow I am on the edge of suicide I dont fit in this world I make jokes of everything and make people laugh But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself Where is the joy Where is my succes Where is my happiness  But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion Now acceptance still lost and no idea where next Am I happy Never Thats just another illusion Im conscious of realityfor now thats enough but not for long

1	Living for the sake of othersDoes anybody feel like theyre simply existing for the sake of their loved ones Im a male going on 21 a CS major at a decent college and Ive been very fortunate in life both financially and socially  However since about sixth grade this has put up no fight to my depression  Regardless of what I have Im unhappy  Thats not to say Im not grateful but this being the sub Im posting to Im sure there are a few of you who get what Im saying  Every day I feel like I exert so much of my energy just living that I find insurmountable amounts of block when trying to do things ie socializing or schoolwork  My parents would just assume Im lazy and my depression has pushed me into a repetitive cycle of wanting to self indulge this is not to ignore my problems but to see if the faintest amount of hope can be found in something I enjoy  However I feel there is no enjoyment I find in things I liked  I simply do them on repeat with no real emotional response to them  I cant remember a day where I havent thought about killing myself at this point and I feel its growing ever nearer

1	Ill never be as happy as I was when I was littleI just dont feel like I see any point in anything anymore if I cant be happy I dont really know where to start or what Im doing but here I goIm very shy and privateI think I always have been and I dont ever feel really comfortable talking to people Im not really familiar with Even online Im pretty much always a lurker As a result I only have a handful of people I feel like I can go to when Im feeling depressed And I just feel like I bring the people I love down all the time Im so needy but I have nothing to offer Im like a child and I dont understand why I even have the few friends I doMy dog is dying He has a cancerous lump thats enormous and has been growing for about a year and a half now I know not everyone will understand and Im not trying to equate this with losing a human being but losing my dog is really really hard Hes been my constant friend since I was 3 years old Im 19 now he moved with me from one country to another and hes always been so gentle and sweet I know hell be gone soon and Im trying so hard to prepare myself but today on the train I finally just started crying I imagined what it would be like never to get to hug him again and it was torture Im away from home right now so Im sitting here in my dorm hugging my stuffed animal like an infant pretending its himOn top of it my anxiety has gotten out of control Ive always had it but I think college has made it much much worse Im very rarely cheerful Im happiest when I imagine what I want my future to be like Silly things like pretending Im best friends with Quentin Tarantino or that I write for the Daily Show I feel like my imagination has been able to sustain me for 19 years but Im old enough now to realize those things will probably never happen and right now I dont feel like I have anything that makes me as happy as my stupid Mary Sue dreams that wont ever come trueI used to want to be a writer but more and more I feel like I have nothing to say and no motivation to try Ironically I really want to write comedy because its the stuff thats always made me happiest but I just dont think I have the ability to make others as happy as comedy has made me So even watching things that used to make me laugh feels painfulTheres so many things I want to do but more and more Im realizing Im not nearly as special as I wish I were Aside from being a good comfort to my mom shes been depressed since her best friend of 36 years died a few years back theres nothing I feel like I can do I used to dream so big and for the past few years Ive been forced to come to terms with how small I really am And I just dont see the point of living for probably decades more if Ill never be as happy as I was when I was like 5 years old and going to Disney for the first time I just dont think Im cut out for itIm sorry this is so long and I dont really know what I want from this I just felt the need to write something I dont want to bother my friends anymore

1	Why notI remember all the cool kids in my neighbourhood could jump to the 4th bar on the monkey bars and I wanted to do it so bad I was too much of a coward to do it at 7 years old so on my 8th birthday I decided I was finally old enough and I went to the ledge to jump I was frozen for about 30 seconds and stepped off I knew I was gonna do it eventually but I didnt know when It was eating away at me for a while until one day I had enough and just went for it My fingers slipped and I wiped out and bruised my tailbone It was exactly what I feared would happen I got right back up though and tried it again and nailed it the 2nd time That was almost 15 years ago Im 23 now If someone were to ask me the last time I was proud of myself it would be that day as an 8 year old I swear to God im that much of a loser For the past year Ive wanted to just sleep forever Im just tired I honestly feel that urge I had back when I was a kid to just go for it and jump  just end it all Right now its not even a matter of will IWont I Its a matter of whenIm 100 sure im doing it but I dont want to Anyone else feel me on this

1	14 MonthsI cant believe its 2013 My depression began at the end of 2011 In an attempt to get better Ive been seeing a psychiatrist 24 times per month and for a stretch of six months I met with both a psychologist and a life coach With my doctors help Ive tried various cocktails of Zoloft Lexapro Abilify Lamictal Wellbutrin Adderall and Ativan None have helped my depression in a significant way Ive leaned on friends and family for support improved my diet and learned mindfulness meditation But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a timeIn short I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as Ive ever feltI attempted to take my life last year but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge which Im told is 99 effectiveI know that if I continue to fight theres still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100 But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100 and I wont be around to regret it I suppose thats the tautology of suicide Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted itIm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll Im already taking and would continue to take on them in the futureAlthough Im pretty convinced of my decision I obviously havent committed to it since Im here asking for help Your advice will be appreciated
1	I cant force myself to care anymoreSorry if this doesnt make sense my memories from the last few months are a little broken Cant really piece it together too well  A little over 7 months ago I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life When we got together she didnt want me smoking weed anymore so I stopped I was a pothead of a sort so this made me a little sad but I decided it was worth it So naturally when we broke up I started smoking again What else should a highschool senior be doing I smoked every single day for about 7 months trying all sorts of new drugs along the way Cigarettes Alcohol Opiates Shrooms LSD MDMA Cocaine All sorts of fun stuff I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her and thats when my drug use really took off I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew to be a different person But now all I am is alone I live in a huge city with no money Im on the verge of failing some important classes and have nothing left All I want is to not be me anymore I dont want to be anyone I just want to be nothing The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been the more and more it all hurts All the cries for help all the lonely nights all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked they all contributed to who I am as a person today Ive tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am but the only person there is to blame is me Im my own Dr Frankenstein After I tried to kill myself I thought it best to seek out a therapist and maybe some antidepressant medication Therapy doesnt do jack shit and the only thing I have to thank my medication for is my now nonexistent sex drive Life is so fucking bland and christ its fucking killing me

0	Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier but heres some background if you havent Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid Turns out that while it does have what I wanted theres a little more on top flash porn Most of these are games games in quotations because really theyre just animations that I can control the speed of One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn If youre not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material I would have to guess about 65 of the porn is actually yiff Like I said not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on no tags or thumbnails included This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess but its also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork However most of what isnt furry shit is low quality which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000s With all that said I did end up finding something to nut to and yes it was yiff not afraid to admit thatOverall I would give using Flashpoint a 610 as a source of fap material Its not practical for your everyday fap but if youre looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little its worth checking out

1	Lost my job the closest thing Ive had to a girlfriend and my last shred of confidenceFor the last few months Ive been out of work on disability for depression which Ive struggled with for the past 15 years I spent a year and a half of high school in an outpatient program at a hospital residential treatment centers laundry lists of psychotropics  Last Thursday I had another meeting with my psychiatrist to finish the paperwork to extend my disability already a month late with a little assignment she had given me  Because she had taken a month to complete the paperwork my office sent a letter stating that if the disability claim wasnt worked out or if I didnt return to work by last Friday I would be terminated  So when I show this letter to my doc she tells me I should just go back to work and that she wouldnt sign anything else affirming my inability to function on the job  I went straight from the doc to a female friends house who had just moved to the city a week before  I had fallen in love with her in high school but then she started dating my best friend  I held my tongue as long as I could but finally just had to tell her how I felt making all of my friends think I was trying stab her boyfriend in the back  So I was shunned by the bunch of them for a good year or so until the bf left the country  However throughout all of this I kept in touch with  the girl with whom I exchanged emails fairly regularly  This was about seven years ago  We go get a bite to eat and when we get back to her place shes all over me the most affection Ive ever been fortunate to receive  We keep out pants on but thats about it  I go home feeling on top of the world  She has some obligations the next day so I spend the time deep cleaning my apt finally doing something productive  The following day we spend the whole day together capped off with even heavier petting and repetitive proclamations of love from both of us her first  The next day last Sunday we were to see a concept together that wed both been excited about for weeks and which she couldnt stop talking about  About an hr before I went to pick her up she sends a text saying she got strep throat and couldnt speak I was a little suspicious given the hours we spent in each others mouths the night before but whatever just wanted to do what I could to help her feel better  No response no response no response must just be sleeping it offFinally Monday night at around 11pm after Id flown to my parents for the holidays I get a text saying I want to be blunt I have no romantic feelings for you  It was like I got the wind knocked out of me before Id even taken my first breath  She defriended me on face book and hasnt responded to anything since  What hurtsscares me the most is that this just makes me doubt even more my ability to understand people which has always been excruciatingly difficult  I dont have a job I dont have any friends I can talk to in my city have an incredible difficulty speaking to those elsewhere and those that Im closest to are in the process of kicking heroin   Every girlwoman Ive ever been interested in has either completely blown me off or led me on for monthsyears multiple I love yous always conditional  Either just over a breakup and need some time or just not in that way  And every time just hurts moreIts been 15 years of people saying it will get better and it will momentarily but every time I fall I fall farther and harder  And after going through the psychologypsychiatry circuit for so long Ive havent heard anything new in a long fucking time  Not to mention that the therapist I bonded most with and helped shape my view of the world who I saw for 10 years had a breakdown himself and no one knew his friendsfamily by the end has heard from in a few years  He was last seen being released from the psych ward  And the psychiatrist I bonded most with 4 years had a breakdown too and stopped practicing  Ive become more and more closed off from new therapists always downplaying suicidal thoughts because I dont want to committed and if I really do want to die I dont want them stopping me  Even when I do open up I just get the same things Ive heard for fucking years  The thought of hurting my family which has been so supportive my whole life is the only thing that has prevented me but even that is meaning less to me as the days go byI dont really know why Im posting here tldr 15 years of depression forever alone lost job teased with a relationship shunned no local friends outoftown friends have their own issues namely heroin

1	Suicide and its cowardice Or is itMuch like the rest of the world I live with the thoughts of suicide day in and out I hear on a regular basis local folk not on the internet that suicide is a cowards method that it is taking the easy way out instead of solving the problemStill Id rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive and quite frankly creepy behaviour that I cant seem to be rid ofIve driven all my friends away save the select few Ive known for years Ive distanced myself from family and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I cant let go of until Im forgiven by whom Id hurt Suicide and for that matter any death is not the easy way out because its enduring one final pain to make the rest stop Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness we embrace it While it brings sorrow to our families they get over it just like the rest of the problems they faceWere remembered for the positives not for the negatives And I think that counts for something Its not cowardice that drives is to that point Its one final breath of courageMuch like many other members of my family Im sure that one day I will join the great darkness Fit now though I have my obsession to keep me alive and people I must care for

1	I dont understand itI have been helping people cope with depression and suicidal thoughts for years and have helped a lot of them get back on their feet looking at a brighter day But in reality Ive been preventing them from doing exactly what I cant sum up the courage to do myself I know I dont want to exist anymore I just dont know why I just need a reason to exist and I cant find one
1	Constant suicidal ideationSo this isnt a new problem Ive been like this for as long as I can remember Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep sat at work  like now  I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up the same thoughts are there all day every day driving to work or coming home seeing my friends doing fun stuff etcIts just constant and never ending I dont really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like Im in mental pain all the bloody timeA couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that its unlikely to respond to medication of which Ive tried a lotThis has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life I lost the woman I love the one person who somewhat soothed the pain because I couldnt commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know Im only going to kill myself I really wanted to be with her marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything elseDespite all this Im fairly successful in business Im what most people consider very well off but really this just hides whats going on under the surfaceI do occasionally talk to people about how Im feeling but almost nobody actually understands what Im saying because theyve never felt what I feel I cant really talk to my best friendex now because shes moved on to somebody new hes a nice guy I think and Im glad that shes with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long runIm not really looking for help I dont know what Im looking for I just spend so much time hiding how I feel I just wanted to put it out there My head hurts and I just wish we had an off switch

1	So I want to die but if I kill myself and there is an afterlifeI wont be able to kill myself in the afterlifeSo given that there is a chance there is something after this life undecided here lets weigh out the options1 ReincarnationI sure as hell dont want to come back to this earth But if I do I suppose I could commit suicide again but then Id just come back to earth again and the cycle would keep repeating2 HeavenEven if heaven is great it involves eternity which lets be realI dont want to live forever I highly doubt I can commit suicide in heaven3 HellThere are many definitions as to what this can be ranging from separation from God to fire and brimstone to merely the gravebut lets assume some sort of eternal torture taking the worst case scenarioI highly doubt one can commit suicide in hellAnd there are many versions of heavens hells what happens when we reincarnate and plenty of other afterlife options but the above are the main ones people argue these days And thats why I cant kill myself Because there is a chance that there is an afterlife and there is a chance the afterlife sucks more than this life and there will be no escapeHelp
0	My fish died Draco a betta fish lived with us for almost 2 years and lived for a total of almost three He never liked to play with toys like most betta fish he only liked other fish we had him alone for a long time and then we got him snails He seemed to swim more and play more after the snails moved in then after the snails died he lived alone for about half a year until last month when we got a catfish He seemed to get along with the catfish but it wasnt until the catfish died and we got 2 frogs 5 shrimp and a platy that he really started to be truly happy again He would swim and play with the frogs and even move aside to let them eat food He was also friends with the platy they would sleep on a leaf hammock together Upon finding Draco dead this morning we saw that the frogs were swimming near him and looking at him trying to play with him RIP little buddy You will be missed

1	Ive become nothing but the physical embodiment of depression selfhate and rage for others I want to dieHow do cisgender men and cisgender women enjoy intercourse simultaneously If so howMen want pressure and the vagina to be tight so that it will close up andor push them out If the vaginal muscles are tight it means that the woman is tense andor scared For men to enjoy intercourse the woman would need to be scared duringBut for the woman to enjoy intercourse shed need to be lubricated aroused and experience vaginal tenting the elongation and widening and loosening of the vaginaBut that would ruin it for the man because the vagina wouldnt be closing up and tight and pushing them out anymoreHow do people enjoy life How do they have sex How do they get an ounce of pleasure from anything I want my pain to go away I want it to be over Is it good for the vagina to close up during Does an extremely narrow vagina feel better to the man Does it feel like the vagina is squeezing to the man or closing up 5 Can a vagina be too narrow What does tight mean and is tighter better What are men referring to What makes men orgasm from stimulation from their penis pressure movement tightness How do cisgender women manage to enjoy penetrationI feel like I have a lot of fear surrounding men because they just want to force vaginas open

1	Nietzsche for the Interested and Depressed   Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception Nietzsche is not a nihilist If you associate him with nihilism dear reader it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche   I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop look around and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese however not only do they seem to be losing the game but they dont quite see the point of even playing They find that everything around them is an false image So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for Congratulations friend if this is you you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man You have made it half the way the way there but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life 	   Beginning with the arguments of Plato Socrates and other Greek philosophers the original purpose of man was to follow a telos a goal to seek the purest form of the self For these thinkers there was a pure form of justice of triangles of logic and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of teameffort This sort of thinking provides at the very least a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children Remember even before you started school how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man 	   Eventually people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant Friedrich Nietzsche Joseph Conrad among others Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms Likewise you seeker of truth have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies and it is here you Nietzsche Conrad Holden Caufield and Hamlet have found common ground however it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world 	   Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction a construct of society rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions it begs the question Why bother with these fictions The answer is That is life A life consists of a collection of actions of doing of being of finding whatever interests you KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE Football for example consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to work Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy 	   While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms you can do nothing with that information Unless of course you are a biochemist 	   I havent expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that Ive been putting off please comment with questions comments hate love criticism and I will try to answer accordingly      TLDR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms however the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for itLook at Maximus Pryme comment for a more focused analysis of Nietzsche than my rambling essay

0	My friends think I care about them less Hello so I am not a very social person but I managed to have a few friends who are very genuine and supportive However I have the tendency to be distant and apathetic at times which I am working on It is also a very stressful period for me and I dont know what to do Lately I have been sensing a change in my own behavior but I dont know what it is so I asked them if Ive changed and one of my best friends said I seem to care about them less but they still understand that Im under stress Thats when I know Im becoming apathetic again and I am now more paranoid than ever about my actions and Im a little scared now to interact with them because Im afraid my actions will hurt their feelings It feels terrible and it makes me feel the need to rethink all my actions and it makes me so anxious It feels as if I need to keep myself under check all the time and I dont like it How do I show them that I care and fix that tendency to disconnect sometimes Because I really love my friends and want to be the best version of me for them cuz they are so dear to me If you could give me some advice I would appreciate it so much Thank you

0	My professor is a hypocrite Im still in highschool taking dual credit but I already hate the idea of college professors especially if they are as problematic as mineMy teacher pretends to be super liberal but is an older man and says extremely sexist and racist things that genuinely hurt certain students in the class  But this isnt even my problemMy professor just thinks he has so much power over everything he acts like he is this high and mighty ruler and if we break the most minute rule we literally will not pass the classI attend my zoom meetings online every single day and I never miss a class but one day I forgot to do the sign in sheet my teacher refused to count me present despite the fact that I interact with the teacher more than almost any other student My professor constantly mentions plagiarism and how its wrong which I do agree with but literally every quiz he makes is plagiarized from some quizlet he finds online Im fine with it because it makes studying and cheating on the quizzes the easiest thing ever but thats pretty hypocriticalI just really hope that not all professors are like this especially when I can see that hes definitely not even close to the most problematic one
1	Just hurt to much and Im so tiredIts been 9 months since my wife of 15 years left She started immediately was most likely cheating dating a friend of mine They broke up a few months later Now shes getting married to a different person he is a great guy My kids love him as she likes to brag to me about All our old friends my own kids even her family that I loved and was closer to me than my own they all are thrilled about this engagement I drank heavily when she left For months Ended up so depressed and drunk all the time that I went  to the ER because I wanted to kill myself I spent 37 days in a facility doing counseling for my depressionI got out and was feeling good again Got a new job got my own apartment was forced to move back home with parents as I couldnt afford lawyer and rent etcetc I thought I was turning the corner and my life was going to be ok And then boom it hits me all again Like she just left yesterday Im so sad again Ive dated a few women recently they all suck compared to her I cant stand any woman for more than sex and a brief conversation Honestly I cant stand when one of them texts me Ill never be normal again I will never love again I will always be this sad alone and hurting I am so tired I cant do this anymore
1	I think its because Im a PhD studentI know that doctoral candidates and mental illness go handinhand and I need to stand cautious against selfdestructive behavior but this PhD is taking me to some dark placesIm recently married to a wonderful lady I have fantastic parents No debt Good health I am in good standing in my program and I have a job offer for when I graduate So why am I getting these thoughts Is it the 80hour workweek with no sign of reprieve Am I imaging all the other students hating me Why dont my advisers ever seem satisfied with my work Why do they treat me and my time like it is worthless I always feel rushed and consequently incapable and irresponsible Is this real or just an unreasonable environment Is this all be compounded by being many many thousands miles away from homeNo one knows it but I am struggling They all think I am making leaps and bounds in my work I am But I am falling fast The only reason I havent offd myself is because of what how my family would take it It would not be not fair to them I owe them more than that but if they were to disappear so would II tell myself this is only for a limited duration that it will all be OK once I graduate but could I be dealing myself some kind of longterm mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape itI want to go home but if I do that now Ill be seen a failureIm in no danger tonight but I operate one day at a timeendrantThank you
1	Theres actually no good reason for anyone to liveEvolutionarily our purpose is hard wired into us to find a mate and procreate Weve moved so far past that as a society that we dont have a reason to live and relationships are flippant things that people use to satisfy their own selfish needs Is the purpose is not to find love and love no lingers exists nothing is worth living for

0	If you think girls dont date nice guys because they wont date you its actually likely because you just have no personality Every dude Ive met with the wahh women only date chads Mentality has had no personality at all Theyre not funny theyre not interesting and they just have no defining attributes Or theyre actually just not that niceIts not that women dont like nice guys its that some dudes are actually charismatic and enjoyable to be around Also they shower
0	So guess who just got a breakup Well just is an understatement Its been 1 month and 4 days but whos counting He dumped me through text He was talking to my online fried about me and was asked if he still liked me So he said and this is a direct quote used to but now Im bi so I have a different group of people to like Five seconds later a screenshot of their conversation was sent to me by him I played dumb at first thinking he meant me to see the Im bi part rather than the used to like her portion I guess I thought he was too good to tell me he was over me so cruelly In the end I gave in and saw what I was meant to see But by then my natural reflexes to hide my emotions had kicked in and I pretended that I didnt give a damn But I did And I still doTo be honest I cant quite work out how I feel about this My emotions range from were mature 13yearold so we can get through this and become stronger together to I know its weird to be around him but you can still be civilised to go die you fucking bastard whos far too chicken to be worth my time Around him I put on a fake front smile laugh act like I dont care but inside it hurts to see him happier without me I guess the fact of life is that I miss himI miss his quirky geeky personality and his obsession with all things medical I miss how he was tried to fit into the crowd and yet managed to be so entirely unique and special I miss the way he would do anything to cheer me up miss his ability to make me laugh in a split second miss how he would make me feel like the only person in the world who mattered I miss our long talks the way I was the first person he approached when faced with any problem and viceversa Most of all I miss the trust we had in each other He was my best friend And now barely a proper sentence passes between us each dayIts been more than a month since I got dumped and I know Im over him Yet I still feel hollow inside like part of me is missing My friends tell me hes not worth it that hes trash and I should move on But I still defend him because were friends rightI dont know if feeling this way is normal and I dont know if what I did in terms of hiding my emotions was right All I know is I want my best friend back but I want him to be happy I dont need him to like me or love me just please treat me as a friend Im sorry to whoever who reads this in new I just felt like typing this out seeking advice or just a listening ear If you read this thanks for hearing me out

1	You dont owe anybody successIn America and elsewhere Im sure the ferocity of competition is incredibly damaging to the soul We blame ourselves for not becoming rockstars or billionaires because were told anyone can do it and its horribly untrue and destructive Capitalism has done great things but at the expense of our humanity So motherFUCK anybody who passes judgement on you for not becoming what they think success looks like On this sub I see heartwrenching stories of absolute terrorhorrors that are so foreign to me But also some that are not such as the feeling of utter insignificance There are wellhidden realms of hell in this world that masquerade as innocuous and even pleasant and so when we start tearing ourselves down despite no true wrongdoing murder rapewe would be wise to realize that it is only a product of our brainwashing and that we are perfect exactly where we are This isnt hippietalkthis is the truth Of course working to better your surroundings is a totally cool goalbut dont attach your selfworth to it You are not worth only what you can produce Your life is immensely valuable all on its own Think back to when you were a kid Were you upset because you werent a prodigy like Mozart So then why do we set such high standards as we age Our programmingI fucking love everybody on this sub Stay strong through the dark Youre all soldiers fighting a battle you didnt enlist in Have some empathy for yourselves

0	A LESSON IN FINANCES As a teenager my parents took the liberty of teaching me the best way to go about finances While you all are still young this is the perfect time to start working on finances and becoming successful in the futureLesson 1 RelationshipsRelationships are key in finances If your future spouse doesnt agree with how you want to live it may be time to consider someone else Most divorces happen because of finances and people who dont agree and if you dont agree with your spouse and end up in a divorce they automatically get 50 of the money you have and if youre a male you have to pay child support and you wont be able to live how you want because you wont have money Now sometimes you can compromise with your girlfriend but make sure it happens before marriage Thats the cutoff that you haveLesson 2 InvestingA lot of you will be starting your jobs real soon here Talk to your parents about starting a stocks account for you Investing is an amazing way to earn money for the future If you want to learn a bit more about this there are all kinds of Youtubers and YouTube videos that explain it all This is one of the best ways to get money and set yourself up for the future and paying for those things you want I have met too many people who didnt learn about this until their 30s and 40s and they regretted it very deeply Invest in the stocks remember this is the time to buy while everything is down from COVID19Lesson 3 Student LoansDO NOT GET STUDENT LOANS Student loans are a HORRIBLE idea They seem great at first but you become a slave to them if you dont pay them off immediately The longer you wait the more expensive they are and the worse life will be for you Do not get student loans One way to avoid that is investing like I said earlier Make sure to set aside money to invest and you will be able to pay for schooling in the futureLesson 4 Your future lifeIn the future after college make sure to set aside some money for investments The best way to go about this is saving 150 a month for your investment purposes and put it into your stocks account At first it may be hard but it will set you up for life and by doing this you can become a successful personLesson 5 SchoolMake sure to do well in school Doing well in school is one of the key components in being successful You dont even have to do super good just try to avoid Cs and 100 avoid Ds and Fs If you can do this future you will be thanking yourself for the work and determination you put into how you wanted to live later in lifeLesson 6 Personal itemsSometimes you will want to buy something nice for yourself like a nice piece of tech or something Do not do this In a few years it will be outdated and it wont be very good anyways so why get a new one now Use the money you WOULD use to get that device or electronic and invest it A lot of the stuff I am telling you will mostly revolve around investing in the stock market and trust me you will be grateful in the future that you were able to learn this stuffJust remember this is something that most people would regret not learning and if you can discipline yourself now you will be setting yourself up to be successful in the future and you can get the things you enjoy to have You will be able to get those cars you want you will be able to get that nice computer and keep updating it Just follow these steps and you can almost guarantee that you will be able to retire and live well

1	Trying to find a reason to go onHi I never thought this would be my first post on reddit To be honest I just got really depressed and googled what I felt and stumbled upon this thread Probably a silly reason to join but I just really needed to talk to someoneAll my life I have been trained to focus on making good grades so I could go to college and get a job I did well at that Ive got a full time job with benefits and Im out on my own And thats it I feel like Ive fulfilled all Ive ever known as my purpose in life and everything seems completely pointless To boot Im new in town and 90 of my friends live 3 hours away The ones that do live nearby flake out on hanging out almost every single time One of my best friends said shed try to move here after she graduates but its apparent thats not going to happen My long distance boyfriend promised the same but I seriously doubt that will happen either And if we cant figure out a way to be together hes already told me thatll be the end of it  So I really dont have anything to look forward to Ive got no real goals to strive for and even if I did I barely have the energy to clean the apartment and make food for myself I tried to confide in a friend last night but all he said was stop whining and do something you like Ive been here before and I know I probably wont actually kill myself but the indifference I feel about going through with it kind of scares me Hope this is okay Thank you for reading

0	These are what I believe to be the hottest things on a girl No makeup all natural I mean I understand having makeup and stuff when youre going out and trying to present yourself in that kind of way Im talking about not wearing makeup everyday because honestly I find no makeup cuter than makeupBraless This might be a bit graphic but I especially like it when your nipples are hard and making an indent within the shirt But I especially like it when a girl feels comfortableGlasses can be really fucking adorable but it usually depends on the person More often then not though its cute afBaggy shirtshoodies Thats just really adorable to me for some reason Idk why but I just wanna cuddle someone when they wear that xDBut yeah I just needed that off my chest Anyway goodnight
1	Im so tiredIm a freshman in college and I broke up with my gf of nine months but i had known since fourth grade Dont ask me why because i dont know our relationship was perfect and I made a quick decision That was three weeks ago and ive felt like pure shit since then I wake up every hour from a dream of her so i cant sleep anymore and im just tired of crying all day and night She wont give me a second chance and im pretty sure has moved on and doesnt love me anymore everyone is telling me to do the same but the thing is i dont want to move on I want her We had our whole lives planned out and everything was perfect We had an argument once Not a fight an argument and i just know that she is the one Yesterday on the train I decided i am going to kill myself And Ive been waiting all day for it to be night time so i can do it These are probably my last hours unless something happens Ive made my peace with god and a recorded a video so people will know what lead me to this and how i feel Im so tired of feeling like pure shit and i need peace
1	It just doesnt feel like I can make it through this timeI keep trying to tell myself that I have been through major depressive episodes before and have made it through to the other side It just doesnt feel like Im going to make it out of this one I feel so lucky to have some incredibly caring people in my life but Ive just become such a burden on them in my downward spiral My work is suffering and that makes me lose my confidence further Ive gotten so deep into this dark place and it truly feels like there is no way out I genuinely do want to avoid suicide but it no longer feels like an option I dont have money or transportation for therapy and Im at a point where I feel like it would be a waste of resources I know how much it would help my mother to receive my life insurance pay out If there is any way I can access some method of convincing myself that life would be worth living id truly be open to taking it But its so far out of reach Why work so hard to continue to live in pain

0	My friend has worked on a project for over 8 months  to help you make friends Match up with questions  based on age gender interests continent willingness to share pictures or voice calls studyingworking status and more    Hello finally something positive that came out of 2020 this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions Basically you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk toThanks to these 28 questions it makes it much quicker to find people that match what your preference is For example you could say youre looking for people from Europe who are 1625 who are willing to do voice calls and theyre also studying and have interests in dinosaurs minecraft or biology Also quite handy there is a filter to not match with low effort based on word count usersWhat is the final result The algorithm searches over 3500 people everyone is mostly from reddit to find you compatible matches The final result is you usually get around 2040 matches  people that meet the criteria Once you have the list you can then send out friend requests to these users or receive requests from them and once either of you have accepted a request you get connected with that person you form a friendship you eventually meet up get married 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involvedThis is what the UI looks like for a match httpsimgurcomaDfqp6EShttpsimgurcomaDfqp6ESThe link is httpsfindafriendclubhowitworkshttpsfindafriendclubhowitworksThe last tip I can give is to not be shy to send requests to people  quite a few people sign up and dont send out any requests People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them so its safe to assume that if you see their profile  theyre probably still looking for a friendExtra info You can be completely anonymous if you prefer you would need a disposablethrowaway method of contact Most people get around 2040 active matches If you get less make sure you have filled out the form correctly  If you include people who havent been active in 2 weeks its  200 You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period Email notifications about requestsfriends get sent out every 30 minutes though not everyone added an email Matches are done instantly But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising Were looking for help if you want to help and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way ufinderofthehumanshttpswwwredditcomufinderofthehumans runs this project Im helping out with getting more attention A big big thank you to them theyve been working on this for more than 8 months now

1	Too many words to describe it few weeks to convey itHello I dont know who cares to to read this at this late of an hour or who puts much thought into it as well I dont know exactly why Im doing this or what I hope to achieve I am a 20 year old young adult in college and working a steady job living with my brother mother and stepfather I have a sister whose moved out and is having a successful life Im quite close to everyone in my family I buy my own things make or purchase hot meals and try to enjoy things while making my way through my life Even going to college and attending classes in my third year Im even openly homosexual and my family accepts me for that even told them when I was very young I also apologize for those who read this thick wall of text its like a cinder blockI should grateful right I should feel like Im normal and happy I should feel like I can look at my future with any modicum of optimism and hopefulness That I should be happy that I have my own things I even own my own car pay for my own phone and so on Arent these supposed to be the elements of hardworking young adults life that help me feel like Im getting somewhere In truth through my eyes no matter what I do try or work towards I have no future I have no idea where I want to go with my life or what I want to do I wake up with the dread of simply existing the days I have my college classes through the day I feel like I simply go to satisfy some requirement to pass the class get the good grade and move on without understanding why Im doing it Why am I shoveling myself in student debt in hopes that Ill figure out a plan that will help with my life to make my family proud as the youngest son or to feel like Im actually earning an education when I BARELY passed high school because screw you math I had to force myself to go this year otherwise I might have never gone back I wonder whats the point of working a job that I dont completely enjoy construction cleanup and I only have the job because of my stepfather and mother because they work it together I rarely only ever talk about this stuff with my mother but at times its brief and I dont say too much and whatever I do say I ask her just to forget about itI have as stereotypical as it sounds no real social life I dont talk to many people aside from family I have a small circle of online friends I feel quite close to but of course thats no real replacement for a relationship with a real person I try to be more out there to have the desire to actually build a social life but I cant find the desire or motivation to do it The only moments where I dont feel that anxiety is when Im by myself in my room sitting with my laptop and juststaring at the screen Ive also never gone to a doctor to get diagnosed for depression Never really have the time for it too busy with doing work which I feel unhappy with and going to school which I dont feel like Im actually doing anything there anymore Even if I go to see a doctor and get diagnosed with depression I would refuse any sort of antidepressants or medicine of that type I feel sick at the idea of needing a drug to help me control my own messed up mind when I was younger I took medicine to help me sleep and now I have that under control and sleep normally I even have a pretty decent sleep scheduleSo whats the point of all this rambling Of me some random stranger talking about himself on a reddit board about depressionI feel like I am a burden That every moment of my existence that isnt spent being a useful person or helpful to anyway to any moment I see like a homeless person and drive by to seeing other people with good hearts doing things that I fail to do it feels like I shouldnt be around There are so many good people in the world all of them living happy lives with hope and idea of what they want to do with themselves while I sit here rambling on and bumbling about with not having fathomed a single idea of what the hell I want to do with myself in the future Im 20 years old and Im not even at the starting line yet and I only have myself to blame I also feel like I am a burden to my mother Every moment Im not spending doing anything I can trying to ease her life considering she took the time to take care of her kids my passed away grandmother when we moved in with her some time ago and going through a divorce from a crappy husband all those times I feel like I am nothing but a failure Every moment Im not working to earn money every penny I dont give to my mother to ease her burden are times I feel like it would simply be better if I sold every single thing I own left the envelope of money in her room and left and never came back One less mouth to feed right One less useless piece of garbage she has to look at I have no future no end goal and any type of objective I try to set for myself like deciding what career I want or something like that I know Im not smart enough or good enough at anything to do it I have no talent in anything Im not smart Im not very good looking and my speech skills are in the negatives Whod want to hire a useless blob

1	Scar tissueIm suicidal I had things happen to me as a child that unknowingly shaped the way I transitioned into manhood When I realized I had problems and was tired of being a person impaired by their own toxic mindset Id tell myself Id change but couldnt do it Mental block They werent just words to me but words to a woman I loved dearly After I lost her  the kindest most loving woman I have ever had in my life  I figured that if I couldnt fix myself for the greatest thing to every happen to me then I was never going to change The only solution was to kill myself And not just to end my own depression but as punishment for the pain I was causing myselfI was getting better I found some help here and decided that the precursors to who I am are not my fault and who I became was uncontrollable But who I can become in the future is my choice I detached my mind from my emotions and inspected myself found things I simply wasnt going to do anymore Not only was I going to do it for myself I was going to do it for the woman I love My actions would speak louder than words and she could return to the man she fell in love with but without the toxicity of secrets and demonsThey say you shouldnt dwell on the past but I dont think thats always true I wanted to use the scar tissue of new and old wounds to remind myself of a path Id never go down againTonight I met her for the second time after I told her I was bettering myself  the revelation that led to her to start communicating with me again We went out had a few drinks She probed me and I let loose I answered her questions told her about the things that happened to me as a kid Then when she pushed me on what I was doing and how deep my problems go I told her about suicide How seeds have been planted in my head and while I dont want to do it now I know I will later I know how things begin but Ive stopped that now And Im a million times better already even if my journey has only startedShe clammed up The revelation made her freeze She didnt say anything else I got emotional I sat down and reassured her that I was OK  Im getting help Im getting better She still said nothing I poured my heart out revealed my dreams and aspirations of showing her my change that I loved her and understood why she left me The love of my life asked me to explain how I understood her how Id understand putting everything in and getting nothing back would make me feel the other person doesnt love me Right after that she said she had to go and off she went into the sunset No response no nothing Here I am back to square one Its like no matter what I do no matter what positive path I try to take no matter how fucking hard I battle with myself and try my hardest to kill the monsters inside me somehow regardless of how far I go I end up where I fucking started

1	Finally met a girl now even thats gone NSFWSorry if I cant explain anything adequately Im a really reserved person and usually keep my feelings bottled up to everyone even my parents I also apologize if this ends up being a novel Im not exactly sure how much info to give but at this point I dont care Basically Im an early twenties male going to a small college In high school I always kept to myself and only had about 5 friends all of them were guys For some reason I get extremely nervous around girls and always find a way to fuck up a conversation Every time I really cant help it When I got to college I tried getting out of my comfort zone by working out and making myself look the best I went out a couple of times in hopes of meeting people and also hoped that the alcohol would make it easier to talk to girls It didnt really Finally a friend of mine introduced me to this girl that seemed to be having the same problems as me I think we hit it off decently well but it was obvious that I was more shy than her  like I said I pathetically barely even talked to girls so I was taking like a couple hours to try to perfect every little text to make sure that I wouldnt fuck anything up Long story short we end up having sex which was my first time and she asked if I wanted to take the relationship more seriously She asked me this the weekend after declining to have sex with her because I had to go home for some reason I cant remember exactly why I had to go home but my friend apparently was talking to her and started telling me that I needed to give her an answer quickly because I was stringing her along I got scared shitless because I had never been in a relationship and after about 10 minutes of being a pussy I told her no After this she kind of stopped talking to me perhaps rightly so She asked if we could have still been friends which I would have liked but every time I asked her to hang out she said no After I realized how stupid the decision I made was I got really depressed Usually I try to make people laugh even when I dont feel the best but during the next couple of months I just got really quiet and more reserved I called my general doctor to ask him for a therapist recommendation and he said the therapist would call back but she never did Fast forward about 4 months the only times I had seen her since saying no had been around campus and stuff The most conversation wed had since then was just occasional hellos I think time healed me a little as I was feeling not as depressed and was even feeling confident enough to see if she wanted to resume what little relationship we had I asked my friend that introduced us if he thought she would be down for it but he told me she was seeing someone Coming closer to the conclusion  now it was nearing the end of summer and I learned that they werent together anymore for whatever reason and I again asked my friend if he thought she would be down to start something again He said that she not only was but she was pretty excited about it This got me really excited because I had been waiting a long time for this moment and she was even seemingly equally happy that it was going to happen Then the semester starts I distinctly remember coming back from a night class and being so happy at the thought that we were going to hang out the next day Then I received a text that gave me an almost outofbody experience She tells me that she is too busy with school and work and that it wont work out The day before we were going to hang out It honestly felt like that Reddit story about the guy who lived a whole life for 10 years and then stared at a lamp for 3 days and realized the last 10 years had been a lie I was so dazed that I felt perpetually high for the next 2 weeks or so It was like nothing I had ever experienced Also again she said that shed like to be friends but also said no every time I asked her to hang out Fast forward almost exactly a month later and shes in a relationship There were many other things that contributed to me wanting to commit suicide but this was the most significant Luckily every other time I thought about it I felt that I couldnt bring myself to do it but lately Ive been feeling like I could Ive been trying to get my mind off of it but I literally cant I spend whole days doing homework whole days watching YouTube videos nothing fucking works I just keep thinking about it If anyone had any advice I would appreciate it Thanks

1	21 year old mother who cant do it anymore Please someone help meI dont know where to begin besides Im a 21 year old wreck I have a 2 year old son who means everything to me and has always helped me push through but Im reaching a breaking pointBackstory I unexpectedly got pregnant by drug dealer at the time to be candid I didnt even know his name I had just graduated high school 3 months prior to finding out I was pregnant Despite the obstacles we managed to form a relationship and stay together Two years into it the more I got to know him the more I realized he isnt who I want in a life partner We separated and I am back at home with my mom and dad who constantly criticize me as a mom I moved back in with my parents because I work part time and go to school full time I cant afford a place of my own and after I separated from my partner I no longer have a vehicle  Even though Ive separated from my former partner he is pushing a relationship He wants to get married and I dont have the guts to tell him I dont love him I told him we needed time apart and thats why I moved out but in his mind there is still hope Im partly to blame because I will use him as an excuse to get out from my parents house for a bit as he is the only friend my parents will allow me to have Im constantly having to lie to everyone just to maintain some sort of peace and a tiny ounce of freedom It is wrong on so many levels but I dont know what else to doIve always struggled with depression Ive been on medication longer than I can recall but the medicine just doesnt help The void and numb feeling I carry reaches the deepest parts of my soul I feel like I have failed in all aspects Im not a good mom to be honest It tears me apart that I dont have the energy or joy like most parents My son now cries for my mother instead of me He doesnt want me to hold him he isnt ever excited to see me just her I just feel hopeless My parents criticize me for not giving my child a stable home and not providing him with the same opportunities that I was afforded growing up There iss so much more to the story but Im feeling like Im rambling Im just basically at a point where I feel completely helpless I feel like everyone my child included would be better off if I simply didnt exist I bought a gun 3 days ago and Ive been fantasizing about pulling the trigger Im finally readyI dont know what made me make an account and post this I think I just needed to put it out into the universe Im a loner who doesnt have any friends just my coworkers and this isnt something you can just dump on a coworker I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this

0	I need some advice Im a high schooler and theres a girl I really like I havent had much experience with girls Ive had 2 girlfriends and one of them cheated Btw Im not into sexual relationships I havent liked anyone in a whole year which isnt abnormal but its been awhile nonetheless She doesnt really talk but she has gotten more comfortable with me We basically have one class together and we talk sometimes I have no way of getting in contact with her outside of school I want to start talking to her one on one but I cant get to her on social media without outrightly seeking her out and friending her She has no mutual friends either so I cant just say that it came up in my recommended I get along with her on more obscure topics rather than music or other heavy topics I cant help but smile when Im around her and I cant stop thinking about her I feel like a creep when I smile around her I try so hard to not smile but it doesnt work all the time I havent been quiet in a long time but I feel myself easing back into that because Im Semishy Although people laugh at my jokes when Im spastic so I guess maybe I should do that to get her to laugh Ive thought about asking for her number but idk if that would make things awkward or not In 3 months prom is coming up I didnt plan on going unless something changed but I know shes going so this may be my chance Im not a great dancer either Ive thought about putting my number in a card for Valentines Day because our school lets us by Crush soda and send it to someone but idk if the school would let me do that Can anyone tell me how to go about maybe getting close to her Im willing to give more details but I just didnt want to leave a big message Thank you in advance

1	Im a bit ashamed of saying it but a girl i kind of liked has a boyfriend nowShes always been too good for me Shes an extraordinary person Very respectful friendly and genuine I just never had a chance Like a 0100000000 possibility I really really tried to tell myself i didnt like her But being honest i guess i liked herI imagined being with her Not in a creepy way I just tend to imagine situations How itd be going out with my friends and having a good time hugging everyone i respect and love i imagine myself doing stuff Id never be able to do or saying stuff Id never be able to sayWe kind of were friends not bug friends just friends Were because thanks to quarantine I lost any chance of getting to know some beautiful people i met not long ago her included Those friendly relationships abruptly stopped because of covid Ive recorded an audiotestament is that an ok term and she was one of the ppl outside of my family i spent most time giving a personal message wishing her the best Its stupid I know I just Never stood a chance Ive never had a girlfriend Im 20yo so Ive got no experience Ive liked a girl just twice Just two times Ive feel Im in love with someone Both were pure idealization just me imagining things Having someone to rely on being able to trust someone hugging someone anytime and feeling better not being alone I feel bad
1	I want to die but I still have hopePretty much what the title says Ive been thinking a lot about suicide but torn about whether I should do it I keep telling myself that things will get better in the future That I just need to hang on and have hope That if I kill myself now Im being a quitter But I know this isnt true There are too many things holding me back If things do get better it may be years or decades from now I cant wait that long So Im leaning towards suicide but Im also grieving for the life I wont ever have

1	The Self Defeating LoopIm sorry ahead of time if this is long but my thoughts are jumbled and I need to get them out somehow I also feel like history is sort of an important piece to the puzzle so I want to get that out of the wayIm a 34 year old transgender woman living in California under someones hospitality Ive been a constant drain on financials and though I help with chores and whatever else needs doing I constantly feel as though Ive created a situation for myself in which I cant really escape from I want to help I want to clean myself up get a job contribute and support the people closest to me But any time I try I always seem to sabotage any sort of positivity or progress that Ive made theres always this darkness on the periphery of all my actions that sort of just eats away at any attempt at forward momentum that I make The shitty thing is I moved out here initially to make that positive change to get HRT to train myself for a career to have and be part of a support network of a bunch of other queer people But instead Ive wasted every opportunity that Ive been given I strained a relationship with someone to the point that we dont talk anymore I stressed myself out learning new skills and when I started taking HRT I got depressed and stopped And this isnt the first time that this has happened its like a constant cycle of like Im going to help myself followed shortly by me sabotaging every single thing that I try to do to the point that I get more and more depressed and the world loses more and more colorI considered committing suicide once before the darkest my world ever seemed to get Ive known I was trans since I was 15 but due to a conservative family and the constant fear of outing myself I kept it pushed down in myself for the longest time Once or twice I tried to vocalize that I was trans to my parents but I was always gaslighted with Oh this is just a phase or Everyone has these sorts of feelings from time to time I hated and continue to hate myself so much I never felt like I fit in with anybody and that sort of crept into my school life and when I barely graduated from high school it crept further into my adult life So much that I constantly had trouble holding down jobs I would spend all of my time alone in my room distracting myself with the internet and video games I wouldnt take showers or take care of myself at all I didnt feel like there was a point to any of it because even if I did do all that stuff I still wouldnt feel like I was myself like I fit in with other people It all culminated to a point where I was on the brink of being homeless during a particularly bad Midwestern winter unable to feed myself having lost a job a month before and having told no one and I thought to myself What if I just slit my wristsAnd the thing was I had entertained thoughts like that before but at that time the thought was so strong and like such a good answer in my mind for everything that was happening that I honestly scared myself I felt like Oh god Im actually going to slit my wrists if I dont talk to someoneSo I talked to my mom During the time that my life was unraveling my parents seemed to chill out a lot Believe it or not a concussion caused my dad to change his whole political ideals to much more liberal and my mom started working on a college campus so she started to get more liberal as well It was lucky for me that their shift in personality happened when it did because they got me out of that bad situation I was brought home and they watched over me and made sure I didnt do anything to myself They constantly told me they loved me and they listened to my problems and it was honestly the first time in my life that my parents had ever done anything that made me feel accepted by themI was finally able to confront my gender issues I started socializing with people and I started building a support network again Hence me moving to California As I mentioned before that has sort of all gone to pot I dont ever want to blame someone else for my problems but the person that I got into a relationship with sort of led me in this direction Everything was fine at first they were helping me and I was happy to be with them but they also had all their own issues with narcissist parents and they seemed to constantly push me away because I couldnt really understand the issues that they were having despite me trying to be supportive Not only that but Im sort of an introvert and theyre an absolute extrovert so like they would go off on these grand adventures and do these things that made me feel unsafeFor instance they liked to go hiking which I would have liked to do but I found out the kind of hiking they liked to do was go off the beaten path and climb up the sides of hills or across rock faces Im not really that physically capable plus Im pretty tall so while going up hills and stuff was easy enough every time I went down a hill I felt like I was going to topple over and fall down the hill and honestly it scared the shit out of me Also Im claustrophobic and they liked to explore sea caves on the beach there was one time they climbed into this small hole in the rocks and expected me to follow I broke down crying because I didnt want to go in there and they just laughed at me the only reason I even went into the cave was because they bumped their head and said they started bleeding so my worry for them won over the fear I had for the caveIts just like wherever they went I couldnt really follow and they would constantly push me away as a result of that They would travel cross country in their car and leave me alone for weeks to months so they could go talk to some conversion camp survivor in Wichita or something It just felt like they gave up on me and as a result I sort of gave up on them and everything else over time And I think I sort of told myself that was just par for the course after all I could never keep a job I couldnt make school work I couldnt make anything in my life really work for me so why should a relationship be any differentLike maybe I was asking too much out of the relationship maybe that sort of support where someone helps you or teaches you just doesnt really exist Maybe everyone is just dealing with their own problems and me having my own problems is just adding to their own piles when I ask for help with somethingI keep dropping anything that I pick up it all just feels useless it feels like Im applying paint to a ramshackle hut on the side of a highway I start running or exercise and stop every couple of months I start HRT and stop every couple of months I try learning a new skill and stop every couple of months No matter what I do I just cant seem to build up the momentum to keep going Like I know that the world isnt going to hand me anything on a platter I know I have to work for the things that I want and I theoretically have no problem with doing the work except that I do seem to have a problem with it I mean I guess the tldr of that is that I just feel like everything is useless I feel like no matter what I do Im constantly in this loop of feeling motivated and then having that motivation just sucked away I feel like Im pathetic a drain on others and just entirely not worth anyones effort much less my own And at the end of the day I dont really know what to do about it Just like everything else Ive tried to talk to therapists multiple times but for whatever reason I end up missing a session or two then I just stop talking to them entirely and I know in my heart that this is just going to happen again if I try to get myself some helpLately its gotten to the point where Ive been thinking about just ending it I want to break the cycle and it seems like the only option I have to do it is to end everything

1	Revenge SuicideHonestly I think Im broken as a person I remember when I was maybe 5 or 6 I would wake up and be excited that everyone was already wake and I could go watch teenage mutant ninja turtles My Dad and Mom divorced when I was in third grade and I think this is where all of this started Things are different being a 31 year old living in a 3rd floor apartment Current Situation I have no job I got fired for getting a phone number from a new girl that started I work in IT so I had access to the employee info I asked her very respectfully if I could take her out for lunchI kicked out my girlfriend right before Christmas because she was talking to some other person Honestly she was a mean snappy person anyways that didnt appreciate me but I enjoyed having someone to be there for me even if she was a distraction of how I felt inside It made me feel better knowing that I was helping her get her life on track againMy Dad and I dont talk very often and when we do hes always asking for help fixing his computer or getting his groceries I live 2 12 hours away from himMy Mom is very stubborn never really can ask or talk about deep down  about feelings or how she really feels about thingsI had been on Prozac 8 months and then changed to Cymbalta took that for about 3 months and I just weened off about 30 days ago I wanted to get off of it because it generally made me that I didnt care about consequences probably had something to do with messaging the girl about a lunch dateIve noticed Im easily irritated generally down  and have been staying up til 4 am I sometimes think that if would be satisfying to breakin to my old job and shoot myself in the cube of the girl that got me firedI suppose Im just looking for some help or input on what I should focus on or should I go back and ask for some other antidepressant Any feedback would help thank you for reading

1	When I lost my mindI have created a throwaway account just so I dont get tarnished on my other one Im a frequent visitor here although it has been a while since I last visited I think Ive lost my mind Now I truly know the meaning of the word Genuinely I think my mind is now lost forever I used to be suicidal I wouldnt do too much But I was attempting mildly about once every few months I have minimal scarring due to my method of choiceAnyways about 9 months ago something deep within me clicked Suddenly I was happy and active I was diagnosed BiPolar I was working around until 3 am every night I was working one full time job part time classes and I was doing extracurricular work all the time I was extremely happy but in an unhealthy wayAfter about 3 months of super energized bliss the light didnt shut off it kind of burned low Now like an ember in a bulb it radiates a general content with life What some people might call happy However along with it is the ashes of my previous depression 20 long years of constant suicidal thoughts perverted my mind I was a sociopath by many accounts Though sensibly ethical and occasionally expressive I was always subtly empty That emptiness carried over after my sudden bout of happiness Now Im content but emptyI feel like a shell I have goals and aspirations now I have dreams and hopes But I cant feel anything Its like instead of being suicidal and having a deep fulfilling desire for suicide Im now just me Just a sociopath trying his best I dont feel like Im me anymore I feel like a robot I walk into the office I make jokes I talk to friends and family Im pursuing other things but all the while I feel like a robot Literally    emotions DELETED  I guess depression was the one thing that made me feel human It was the occasional despair that tied me to this Earth Now I feel beyond it If I was fired today I would feel nothing If someone hated me deeply nothing Now instead of falling deeper into sadness I feel nothing It sometimes makes me want to murder or steal Just to feel that rush of guilt and despair as my life falls apart But Im much too ethical to abuse another life just for my own Sometimes  though  I fantasize about the court room About the jail time How Id ache to be free again ache for something My only driving force is to educate myself further and further until Ive conquered the educational world Until Ive learned physics and math to a level that I consider prideful So essentially I feel weightless and empty now Like Im floating around the world I have nothing to ground me Does anyone else feel this way

1	SERIOUSPlease talk to me Im barely competent but Im struggling with my friend who is the one who just attempted suicideSo a few days ago I had to rush to my friends house that called me to help my friend who was so incoherent that even once I arrived a 12 hour later should have taken me 45 minutes but I was doing 90mph in a 45mph zone I still had to pull him out of bed slap the shit out of him to make him barely coherent and spent the next 23 days with him to make sure when I turned my back he wouldnt be gone Ive contacted all of the friends that hes purposely ostracized himself from He has a doctors appointment to go see a medical professional but Im pretty sure thats not going to be enough what if anything can I do to help I held him in my arms for an hour and slapped the shit out of one of my best friends and before you say call a hospital were in the USA and this would be a 510k price tag which would not encourage him to no longer be there he believes it would be simpler to just remove himself from the situation I think the worst part is Im not in much a better position myself but I can do for others where I feel crippled to do for myself suggestions and please if I dont respond individually just assume Ive tried that or Im going to Im now running on almost 4 days awake with microsleeps and I think I might actually be able to manage 56 hours tonight because someone else is watching him
0	ive been talking to this girl for over month now and i really want to ask her out But i think im too scared to do it she already knows that i like her but i dont know what she thinks about me she told me tonight that she loves messaging me and i feel like she might be trying to hint at something i need help fellow teens
0	I dont know what she wanted from me She asked who I liked and I told her When I revealed it was one of her friends she immediately told me not to like her She was with her boyfriend then and I had already moved on months ago What did she want from me Why did she keep me around At that point we were so close that people thought she was cheating with me So why keep me around
0	Relationship advice Just met this girl for the first time after texting for a week with her It was me her and 4 other friends I really like her because she is shorter than me and Im short so thats surprising and she is funny and she is pretty but she has a boyfriend also I dont know what to do
1	All I can think about is what it would be like if I had taken chances What if I took sports when I was younger instead of reading all day I sure as hell wanted to What if I actually practiced guitar instead of sitting around listening to music Would I be able to play my favorite songs What if I wasnt so weird when I was a kid Would I not be alone right now if I were a normal kid What if I talked to that one girl Would I have found a friend What if I wasnt raised in this crappy town What if the gun went off during the early morning hours of 62017 Where would I be Now all I can think about is trying again Im sorry for rambling I just need someone to talk to who will understand

1	i dont fit in anywhereive been thinking about how isolated and alone i feel im a junior in high school rn i have lots of acquaintances that Ive never talked to outside of classschool and i have a few friends that i do hang out with every now and then but im not close with any of them at allits a pretty mixmatched group two of the kids are pretty popular and have lots of friends the other two are kind of nerdygeeky but we still all have fun when we hangout despite our differencesim somewhere in between id consider myself pretty smart and love learning and stuff but i guess i can come off as a cool or chill dude too i crack jokes with popular kids and can have smart conversations with the not so popular kids im nice to everyone i dont care where you lie in the social ranking as long ass you arent a dick to mefor the most part tho i tend not to be friends with popular kids as most of them are douchebags and im really shy anyway i usually talk to this one group of stoners as they arent really popular but definitely arent nerdy eitherim kind of rambling at this point but what im trying to say is pretty much that i feel like im too cool for the nerdy kids they dislike me because i hangout with people that they dont like and make the assumption that im douchy as well and i dont fit in with the cool kids either as im too awkward and nerdy and dont make fun of other kids with them the way i see the groups at my school would be the stick up rich kids who are just complete assholes to everyone for no reason and the extremely overly nerdyweird noitall kids no offense to them i dont dislike them BECAUSE they are nerdy we just tend to not have compatible personalitys  and cant bond over anythingi just feel like i dont belong anywhere im an outcast no one has the same humor as me besides my friend in California that ive known my whole life hes the closest friend i have and hes the only friend i have that i can just be my complete self too but hes on the other side of the US i moved to Florida a few years ago we still communicate often by playing video games together i wish i knew kids over here in Florida with the same type of personality and passions that we doits like im a jack of all trades but not good enough in either group to stick around or make meaningful relationshipsTLDR  im an outcast at my school i feel like Im to cool for the nerdy kids and too nerdy for the cool kids i can fit in  blend in with either group but we arent similar enough to make or WANT to make any kind of meaningful relationship its like no one at school interests me and im not interesting to them either

1	The aftermath of a suicide  please readI know so many of you are hurting But I need you to know something The aftermath of a suicide is like nothing you could possibly imagine Tomorrow will be 3 months since we buried our 17 year old son He was the second of 5 children He suffered from depression and anxiety had had multiple hospitalizations meds and doctors We would have done anything he needed In the months that have passed our family has suffered more than anyone could fathom My children cry themselves to sleep plenty of nights My husband is a walking zombie I cry around the clock and cannot function I dont judge a single one of you I love you all and wish I could take your pain But tryreally truly try Tell your parents your loved ones and if they dont help keep trying You have a purpose What you may ask To light the candle for others suffering So they know they are not alone not to blame for how they feel and that someday we will find a cure You are NOT your depression That is a separate beast that is stealing who you truly are It isnt different from cancer Treatments are weak at this point but we are all trying and fighting for you all So no dont listen to depression telling you that you are a burden No one is better off without your light The world will forever change without your path Yes these are dark times but suicide submerges All who love you and although you dont think so  again depression is tricking you will suffer And they will suffer for an eternity But they wont have a way out because they will see and experience the aftermath I have mixed feelings about this forum Some messages are loving others are speaking via depression I wish you spent a day with a survivor so that you saw the pain and suffering And that it would allow you to understand that depression is your enemy Its tricking you and stealing you But it is not you Love you all Tomorrow 3 months out will be another day of hell while we battle our guilt despair failure self hatred and pain of missing our son That is the aftermath of a suicide Every single one I am a mother of an angel Please try again today to find the strength to fight if not for yourself  for the community of mothers fathers siblings friends grandparents children and everyone who will never forgive themselves no matter what you write in a note You cannot sum up a lifetime in these notes You cannot understand that you were loved from the second you arrived with a love from so many that you are unaware would have taken your place to have you back here in an instant

0	I freaking did it My mother told us a couple weeks ago that we werent celebrating Halloween My spook vibes did not resonate with that Her reason was that we were Christians and that we shouldnt celebrate the holiday Weve been Christians for years now and this sudden change didnt really make any sense We bickered and finally she said we could celebrate but she wasnt buying anything So your boy went ahead and bought his 5 siblings their costumes along with one for himself I also bought a large amount of candy so I can hide it around the house for the little gremlins to find Then were gonna watch Halloween movies until we crash Its a safe fun and non satanic Halloween and I planned it all on my own I hope everyone has the spookiest of times Stay safe and brush your teeth

1	Im 16 have a loving family dont have any money problems either but i still feel empty and want to end my mental miseryI am gay and havent told anyone I live in a country where it isnt excepted and i believe and follow a religion which says that people who participate in gay activities should be stoned to death on a tall building and that they will forever rot in hell But i still firmly follow itMy family is religious so i feel like they would change their attitude towards me if i came out and i feel like if i do come out and they show any other emotion other than acceptance Ill start begging them to kill me or just kill myself I feel like Im never meant to be happy Forever lonely putting on a mask to prevent people from coming in  Its not like Im never happy its just that most times when i feel happy its only temporary and its only a matter of time before i break down again and then theres college and studies being there to bash me down further I cant bring myself to start studying and that makes me scared that i will turn into a failureI feel like coming out might fix my suicidal urges but theres an equal chance that it might lead to me killing myselfi want to leave this country and be alone but i also love my family too much to leaveand leaving will still only be possible if i can force myself through college and university and actually be able to earn for myself

0	What I would change with the school system in The USA The time it starts people arent ready to learn until 1030 am Not 830 or before So schools open at 900 and start at 1000 Ends at 325 with no homeworkStandardized tests are now banned they put too much stress on people and the only tests that will stay are the SAT and ACT for college purposesThe only required class would be Math as is used in every job Every other class is optional and classes would last for 45 minutes each You need 5 classesMore language options instead of just French and Spanish as more people have interests in different countriesMore creative based classes and classes explaining how technology works and how to fix it

1	I have no good reason to feel like this and my personality makes it difficult to reach outMy head is a mess and this is sure to be a rambling pile of garbage I never talk to anyone about my problems and just posting something like this is extremely uncomfortable for me  I am sure I will rethink my decision to make this post and delete it but I havent been able to find any help yet  I figure if there is anything I have learned from 10 years on reddit its that they have a help area for everything  Sure enough when I did a search here you guys areQuick rundown on me  I am middle aged married with kids and successful I dont remember what it feels like to be happy I cant recall the last time I felt any kind of joy  I have become really good at faking it around friends and family  Just flip a switch in my head when its time to be social act happy make jokes play my part make sure my sadness does not leak out and spoil the day for anyone else  Its exhausting sometimes for work I have to smile and keep my shit together for 12 hours straight  Im the nice guy that everyone depends on to get things done Im the nice guy that everyone looks to for support and advise Im the nice guy that is so exhausted from faking it all day long I have to sit in my car breaking down to the point that I get physically ill and have to throw upthen I have to flip that switch again because its time to go home and pretend everything is fineI get the feeling that everyone around me is jealous My family is a dream my wife is beautiful my kids are all amazing I have a large home I drive nice cars I make a good living for the area I live in  To me it all feels like a costume covering up realityI feel like I have failed my oldest child she is about to be an adult and I know she resents me  I try to force myself to be more involved but its exhausting and I do try my best to shield her from my bullshit  I have some younger kids that I also feel like I am failing  I cant seem to give them all the attention they deserve and I feel like they hate me for it  I have heard them talking to eachother and night about me and it just crushed what little of my soul is leftI think my wife is planning to leave me  She has told me for years that she felt trapped and she needed some independence  I did my best to support her in starting a new business and its finally working out for her and going well  I always thought that would make things better but instead that unease has festered and grown stronger  I can feel it she resents me and I can tell that she is just holding on long enough to set herself up with someplace to go when she leaves me  We have had issues in the past but I have always been able to flip that switch put on the brave face and do whatever it takes to work it out  I have been trying but I feel spent and keep cracking up  I almost broke down in a tears at my own birthday party in front of my kids a simple dentist visit was too much and I almost started bawling while making a cup of coffee after If I cant keep my shit together in normal situations how the hell do I do it for something big My business life is a sham I feel like I have been faking it for 20 years now and at any moment someone is going to call me out on my bullshit  It seems rock solid and everyone assumes that I am kicking ass but its always a razors edge balance  I feel like family here but I know how quick family can turn on you and shut you out Its all become too damn much I just want to be done with everything  I already set everything up I have had a plan in place to put an end to things while shielding my friends and family as much as possible  It wont look like a suicide and no one would ever think that I did  Just another tragic accident no different than all the others that happen every day I took out a large life insurance policy I established a trust for my children I prepared documents with my attorney to handle my estate  In the past simply having a plan in place was enough to keep me level and not do anything drastic but the last month or so its been a real struggle every single day to not just do itI have spoken my my wife about feeling depressed and she wants me in therapy but thats another mountain to climb and I dont know if I have the energy to make it happen  I had a therapist a few years ago and called her to set up an appointment last week but she refused to book me  I dont recall how I ended therapy last time around but I must have said or done something horrible if she wont take me back  That was a punch to the gut and I havent been able to make myself pick up the phone and call another one  Quite frankly just the thought of sitting in a therapists office again makes me feel ill and uneasy  I dont even know if it ever helped me or just made me better at faking it for everyone elses sake TLDR I am exhausted tired sad and just want to be done
1	Feeling like everyone would be much happier without meIm not sure I can keep feeling this way Have you ever felt like if you disappeared or just died that no one would even notice Not even the people you hold so dear to your heart Ive been screaming for help for a year and no one even cares No matter what Im wrong For once Id like to be acknowledged and respected I just want to feel loved I just want to feel anything other than despair and distrust At this point in time Id prefer to not exist at all than continue on fucking up everything and everyone elses lives Im only bringing them down I wish I could take back all the hurtful things Ive done to people I wish I could rip out the parts of my brain that cause me anxiety and hold memories that I wish didnt exist at all Most of all I wish my wife loved me like I love her I wish she had the same feelings for me that I do for her I wish I could know for sure whether shes being faithful I wish I knew how to trust her If my marriage and family collapse Im as good as dead Im terrified that these past 6 years were for nothing Just need someone to talk to Someone to help me understand my mind or understand what Im going through

0	Youre in my dreams  Long before we know ourselves our paths are already set in stoneSome may never figure out their purpose in life and some willThere are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live inContent with being blinded by rules and judgmentWe live in a world where its more okay to follow than to leadIn this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed toBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threatNot many people stood up against the system we all call lifeBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voiceA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some timeA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honestThis is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams tooThis is the story of the Man On The Moon

0	I did an experiment with the Placebo effect As I was going up to my bedroom my sister took my pillow I have two pillows because hers was uncomfortable Now that pillow that she took is extremely comfortable and she felt a lot happier with it she said I took the pillow back and she started to get very grumpy She threw her pillows on the floor and started mumbling some stuff that I couldnt hear She became extremely upset over the pillowBecause she is young I thought it would be interesting to do an experiment on her because she doesnt think a lot She just does stuff I changed the pillow covers so she had my cover and I had hersI then gave it back She seemed delighted and started blabbering about how comfortable it was and how the other pillow hurt her neck whereas this one was perfect She thought that it was the same pillow that she took from me whereas in reality it was the pillow she was complaining aboutShe is happily snoring and I have no intention of ever telling her about itIt is very interesting how the brain works
1	I only have a future of suffering ahead of me I will do nothing but suffer and struggle and in the end I will be broke alone and spiteful Why wait when I can end it now25 no degree no career dealing with mental illness  I take medicine and it doesnt help  I cant drink alcohol or coffee because it would interact negatively with my medicine  I cant have friends because I will provide no positive reason to be in their life  My parents did nothing but make my life hell and they stole my life savings  My brother doesnt acknowledge me  The only comfort I have are my pets and I regret not being able to bring them the happiness that they deserve  Once I find a way out I cant bring them with me unless I find a way to afford itI had such a negative experience growing up and it continues to this day  People tell me it will get better and I have a whole life ahead of me but to me those are just empty platitudes  I know that I can find a way out of this but I dont believe it will ever make me happy it can only make me slightly less miserableI dont have anything that brings me any kind of motivation  I dont care about material goods or visiting places or being around people  I dont care about parties bars or volunteering  I dont care about any social cause  I just dont care about anythingI want to stand on a cliff and have one last look at the beauty in this world that will eventually be destroyed by man then end my life right thereIm not made for this world  If there is the possibility of reincarnation who knows maybe I will have better luck then

1	The plans is in actionI have lived a pretty amazing life Ive traveled the world Ive thought thousands of young people and positivity influenced the lives of others I have some rules about suicide You cannot do it until youre at least 840 We got to give life a chance When youre young and dont have a lot of control of your life and seem like theres no end in sight but their at maybeIf you decided not to have children you have to stay alive for them no matter what otherwise youre a big piece of selfish assIve contributed enough to the world  I dont have anything left I have not had it girlfriend in a while I dont have a hope thats will change I wish the suicide was acceptable because I would love to say goodbye to my friends Let them how much I love them  Thanking about how to let them know I love them without making them sad or feeling somehow responsible  I am a little worried about my mom but shes got a great husband and shell survive I have waited till I gave  my life 100  Its time
0	Honestly Im not one who usually makes these kinds of post and some of yall might disagree so HOT TAKE HELLA RANT COMING UPI dont like to talk about my childhood or my past pretty much cause I like to leave it behind me But to give a very vague summary It wasnt great I grew up without a home had a broken family and struggled quite a bit in school because of that alongside mental illnesses I truly believed from the age of 1214 that my future was either me becoming some stripperprostitute or being 6 feet under Because I saw no options for me and I KNOW someone out there reading this can somewhat relate I know someone out there has a mental illness or life situation that makes it hard to picture a future where your life isnt complete shit and none of this is my fault and its not your fault either its just unfortunate life circumstances that put us in these situations That being said and here is the controversial statementI was and still am so sick of people with savior complexes trying to lift their egos up on saving me when really they dont give a shit This does not apply to people who genuinely love and care for peoples well being like you KNOW yourself and you know when youre being genuine So this post does not apply to you But Ive had people use me for their own gain to make themselves look like great people Ive had so many Friends make public post before saying Look at how great of a person I am because I am friends with this girl who went through all of this and I am helping her posting MY traumas to stroke their own dicks Or even people who Ive dated who would make their own statements or brag to their friends about dating someone like me Had an exgirlfriend use that exact statement SOMEONE LIKE METo everyone in my life who has truly helped me I love yall and yall know who you are But people who have been through it we know when yall are faking it to feel good about yourself we see right through it Final note If you are in a shitty situation right now and you see no bright future I have so much faith and belief in you that you can fucking take this head on and win You have a chance and you can win this fight And once youre out of that dark tunnel know that its YOU who did it YOU took that challenge head on and came out Dont let no bitch try to make some dumbass instagram post saying Look at what I did nah bitch you did that If you actually read this entire post btw know that I love you sm And I know some people are gonna be like thats so rude of you to say someones an asshole for helping you and its hard to explain but what these people are doing isnt help Theyre milking my trauma for them to feel good and it ultimately makes me feel like shit

0	Hey I just need some help real quick any input would be great So me an oblivious dumbass went 4 months not realizing a girl had liked me well she told be after the school year ended 2 years ago funny thing was the entire time I liked her too well then we ended up having this weird fling thing things got more serious and she kinda just ended it saying she just wants to be friends issue is I never stopped liking her a year after all this we both end up getting into separate relationships and well they both end up ending around the same time funny enough I just want to say the reason I broke up with said girl was not because of original girl well pretty much the entire time weve off and on talked and she came into where I work today and messaged me we talked for hoursissue is I still like her and well my oblivious ass combined with over analyzing has got my head spinning and it has for basically this entire scenario I have no clue what to do I dont think I should mention anything but due to over analyzing I may be reading into some things she said way to much mostly just like I have my reasons but I wont tell you this is when she was saying Im not an asshole dont remember specifics but I think I said I can be a slight assailed from time to time like every other human then near the end something that happened during my big oblivious time was brought up but she kept on saying stuff like Im going to go to sleep so I keep my mouth shutstop talking and its got me real confused But yeah my main question is justwhat should I do I really have no clue and I have insomnia and Im sick now so I already cant sleep but this whole thing just has my head spinning going over situation over situation thinking Im just some oblivious dumbassbut Im probably just reading into it too muchTo anyone who helps and is readying this far thank you so muchTldrIm known to be oblivious but Im also analytical and tend to over analyze Ive liked this girl for years now and I dont know what to do due to past occurrences
1	The very first people that want you to stay alive are the last to helpI posted yesterday about euthanasia in unpopular opinion and I only got down votes and posts it will get better youre too young Thats what I mean exactly this Why does it bother people that someone wants to humanely opt out be gone be doneThe more I think about all this the more it seems to be the best thing to doWe will die anyway but for someone whos been dead already what difference does it make If you went through some sort of trauma it will always be with you it will always haunt youThere are so many variables in life they all matter Dont even try telling me otherwise because that will be straight up lie Youll never live the life to the fullest youll never experience what it has to offerMental rape lives a mark its like a scar I would rather die by euthanasia or assisted suicide but I could never afford it its quite ridiculous that people who think that are helping others are at the same time exploiting them or maybe its just a poor person perspective Maybe those XX thousands required arent that much in rich countries and are easy to getIve been to a forest yesterday took me 3 hours to go back and forth the only place where I feel free and welcome where I feel somehow stable I guess thats the reason why so many people decide to end it all there makes sense We live alone we die aloneTomorrow Im going there again and I hope its the last thing I will ever do Ill endure seconds of pain that will in fact save me years of even more pain in a long run Thats the only compromise I see the only way as what has been done cant be undone and there are no other ways of changing my situation unless I won some lottery ticket so I could start fresh live in Canada USA Australia New Zealand be a truck driver or whatever But one thing is certain Ill never stop thinking about it so who knows how long would I live my new life I do not look forward to anything no plans dreams friends lovers no nothing to be honest Pointless existence Ill be forgotten No skills or even worthy education

1	Suicide and the ending resultsSo this is my first post to Reddit I dont honestly know how this works but one of my exs was on here constantly and told me theres a section for advice so something has been in my troubled head for quite some time now and Im ready to see what other people thoughts are or support on the issue The thing thats been on my mind or at the very least pops up more times than I think are healthy The thought being suicide First and for most I started dabbling in drugs at an early age and became a fascination I became consumed with trying all the drugs Id do research on and when the opportunity came up to get hands on said substances I sure didnt hesitate to so Since I was 17 Ive been to 4 different rehabilitation programs 2 mental health facilities arrested a total of 5 times The last ending in in prisonment at the age of 20 I was put on a anti depressants at 17 and ever since then Ive been medicated with just about every behavioral drug there is At some point I completely lost myself and just cant remember the last time I felt normal Things just arent the same anymore Ive always been a text book over thinker and easily stressed but latley its just become too much handle at times I cant seem a happy medium in what I think would help Im off all meds besides Xanax which Ill be honest I did have a problem with in the past but do not abuse it anymore strictly for assistance Im trying to get to the point where maybe I feel some sense of normalcy but its getting old Sorry I just figured some sort of vague background would help with the input But it just feels like no matter what I do Im not happy and have no sense of value to my life Couldnt care less if I die tomorrow but I dont think Im lucky and it would still tear my family up which is the main reason I feel is stopping me I want to just be done life its hard to imagine my life ever getting back to happiness if I even know what that is anymore But the impact my action would absolutely just devastate my family mother especially It wouldnt be fair to her or the rest of family because theyve put so much effort into getting me clean or back on track with like not to mention nobody loves me more than my mother I just dont know I have a great job that pays very well and lets me travel for a living but for some reason I just wish I could go to sleep and stay that way Call me a coward but Im tired of this constantly being a thought and just want to help because I just couldnt feel right knowing the devastation I would inflict on my loved ones but jeez give a guys break

1	Self Not sure how to approach professional helpThis is a throwaway accountI feel as if I have fantasies of jumping off the third floor of my university quite often and though I dont necessarily feel as if I will do it in the near future some days I just wish there was some sort of trigger that just makes me go and do itI want to seek professional help like a therapist but I just dont know if I could afford someone that is meaningfully relatable I feel as if my depression continues like this for a few more years I will come to an end inevitably Instead of therapy I mostly selfmedicate my depression with weedWhat options are there for longterm therapeutic help Someone I could develop a close connection and understanding with like a friend
1	Ive had these overbearing thoughts of Suicide and Self harm for 2 years now I want this battle to end alreadyThis school started off great optimistic and care free I thought I won my battle with depression until I started falling in love with this girl she is amazing However my constant thought of getting my heart broken spiraled outta control and it turned into self deprecation cynicism pessimism and suicidal thoughts Im still fighting this battle however each day the support gets less and less I no longer have a sturdy shoulder to lean onto If I fall over well thats it for me Im sorry if this barely makes any sense

1	Cant stop thinking about killing myselfIt is starting to turn into something I think about all the time  I always think about killing myself and suicide  My life right now is horrible and has been for a very long time  I am only 19 but I honestly dont have anything to live for  I have no friends despite trying my best to make friends this year  I also have no job and never had a job in my life  I also think I might be seriously mentally ill plus I have depression  I am seeing a therapist who isnt that helpful  I really think I will kill myself within a few years  If things dont get better I cant see myself living any more
1	ApathyIve lived a good life so far I graduated from a decent college with good grades I enlisted in the Marine Corps because I felt like it was something that I had to do I dont think Im being a narcissist when I say that I think Im well liked even respected by my peers I just feel so damn empty Its not that bad when Im actually doing my job which I guess is a good thing because thats when Ive got the best access to a means of killing myself my rifle But in the quite moments when Im by myself I realize that there is no point to my existence Im just going through the motions I dont care The only thing stopping me is that I dont have a convenient means of ending itSeeking help would just completely fuck up my career and give me an actual reason to kill myself I could talk to the chaplain but whats he going to do Hell listen to me bitch about my shitty little life and tell me everything is going to be okay Reddit can do that just fineI was hoping the infantry life would offer me a meaningful death but we literally arent fighting anyone right now at least not in the conventional sense Were not even doing any direct action shit in Afghanistan anymoreI dont know why I wrote this

1	WaitingEveryday its dwelling of thoughts of mistakes the people that have taken advantage of me most of which were friends the things that I had no power to control in the past thoughts that have completely destroyed my motivation and pretty much put everything that could have been me in the trash I think about doing something with my life getting a career anything but the thoughts are just like the skips in a good movie youre trying to watch Sure the movie may be good but still if it skips every few seconds you couldnt really enjoy it Every single thought of making good use of myself is coupled with the memories or thoughts of the past or future and Im just put down every single timeIve tried to escape them Ive been successful a few times after some kind of positive thought came across my mind but only managed to forget about them and somehow falsely felt like I was stronger and better than the mindset of the guy who was before that positive thought came along After that a day or three Im back the the same old thinking It sucks to see people just like yourself doing the things that you wish you had the willpower to do but just cant Im depressed unmotivated and have problems that I know would just make everything worse than they are now in the futureIm killing myself in the upcoming months 4 months at most Its what I really want unless someone or something convinces me otherwise Theres no one I care enough about to not leave behind not one person in my family or my friends Ive never cared about Yes I understand what kind of impact it would leave on some of them but I think about it and force myself away and train myself to just forget about them and not care about them I think about them and I remind myself every time just dont care about them and cut them off Researching and knowing the best methods planning and having shitty people in your life that wont go away just makes it easier to let go of so little Why would I fight for this and why would anyone fight for anything the dont want or see no benefit in if theyre not forced to Im curious though what is that something that could help me and make everything better I dont see it and I dont know what it is and that makes me give up but you would need to go on to find out if its there but its easier said than doneTalking about what is bothering me specifically feels out of place and isnt very fitting to talk about in most places but its better to get something out than nothing Im thinking about getting help butTheres boundaries for what youre able to talk about with certain people especially around a doctor and that just makes it harder to get help Medication is a huge turnoff and unless someone forces me Im not going to want to take it I dont think medication would be appropriate anywaysAny experiences with doctorstherapy andor medication for any mental illness Why fight for something you dont want
1	I want to be doneI feel so tired and alone Ive struggled with mental illness since I was a kid and I just want to be done with everything I dont feel like anyone loves me or even likes me except maybe my parents but I dont feel like it goes beyond loving me just cause Im their kid They dont actually love me for me And even if they do I dont feel like I can open up and talk with them about how Im feeling and about my problems Im just to anxious to do it Im very lonely Ive only ever had a friend once in my life but it didnt continue after third grade I wish I had someone I was Imoctant to Someone I could trust and openly talk to about anything who made me feel safe and wanted Im tire of being an unwanted nuisance to everyone around me I want to go somewhere where I feel like I belong More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself I guess it does feel good to at least get all of this off my chest

1	Suicide is the easy way outNo it most definitely is not It is not always easy to pull the trigger or swallow the pills The cowardly thing to do is wait for death to come to you After life has ravaged your body and mental health The brave thing to do is admit you arent meant for this world stand up and punch death in the dick Screaming I go on my terms not yours I am that guy I dont fear death and I will go out on my terms I will not die in an old decrepit meat suit in some nursing home Im going while Im still sorta young Ill never be an old man in anyones memories and that to me means something

1	Well this is as good as its gonna getFrom someone elses perspective its probably pretty lousy but I guess I had some fun Dont really remember it since I was either drunk or high Probably not as smart as I like to think I am Barely made it through high school In hindsight it all seems so easy and obvious to me but I guess thats the nature of hindsightI probably shouldnt have been so lazy but I cant take that back nowThats kind of always been my problem Never could be arsed to make any sort of effort For anythingHad some friends The italics are there because I cant think of what real friends are Theyre basically people I knew from school and we would get drunk together on weekends Not much else to do around here Being alone felt much better as there wasnt any pressure to say the right thing and or worry youre acting stupid Everyone says that it doesnt matter what others think of you but thats not true People talk Gossip You always have to make people like you or else they turn their back on you Make your life harder Noone can make fun of you when youre alone That probably makes me a pussy I dont careI always hated alcohol I get really drunk of only two beers not to mention hard liquor And people I hung out with are real heavy weights Weed was more my thing but since I dont live in California or elsewhere more weed friendly its kind of hard to get around hereIt felt nice Music was always amazingThe paranoia was kind of a problem but somehow managed it Potheads arent really regarded as much more than junkies around here anyway so I always smoked alone Preferred it reallyHavent smoked for weeks since I ran out of moneyEveryone stopped calling me months ago The girl whose house where we usually hung out her father died and they sent me messages to come to his funeral Never really met him heard he was a great guy I didnt go since this seems like a perfect chance for them to forget about me Who wants to remember an asshole who couldnt be bothered to even pay his respects to his friends rightHad a girlfriend for a while She is like 6 younger than me and I felt like a huge pedo dating her Shes really nice girl huge stoner We dated kind of infrequently for about six months Then I just stopped calling her I like to tell myself that she got bored with me or found a better guy or got back together with her ex Or that Im not really the best guy for a girl like that and our relationship wasnt healthy  But honestly I was probably just using her to finally lose my virginity  I hurt like hell and after that I couldnt see why sex was such big deal for meShe probably hates me now she seemed the vindictive type I cant really say I know her all that muchMy family doesnt really like me I was in a mental institution for an attempt a couple of years back and that brought shame to the family I only figured it out recently that being institutionalized was going stick with me with everyone I meet People somehow always found out Cant really talk to them They have their own problems theyre own lifes Dad is a happygolucky kind of guy for everyone he meets At home he was a dick who made fun of us and belittled everything Mom always hated him She constantly said she was going to divorce him though it never happened I never understood why they even got married in the first place they never liked each other I have an sister a year older than me We havent talked in years even though her room is right next to mine She doesnt want to deal with me Shes loud and yells at everybody I dont think I could talk her Shes successful Got a degree and shes meaning to move out the country Why would she want to bother with a brother like meI dont have a degree in anything I dont have any skills or trades I cant even drive Its too late to learn now I dont have any money and I cant ask my family for money since I know they dont have any All I ever did was daydream Play games Watch dumb movies and TV shows Browse the internet constantly reading forums reddits wikipedia and never learning anythingI could have used my PC to learn some programming or web design or anything But I didnt Never wanted toNow its too late I thought about just leaving going to another country Everybody is leaving these days There is nothing here but growing poverty envy jealousy and rightwing hate They say our country will like Greece and Spain Smart educated people like my sister are leaving and probably never coming backBut I cant figure out what would I do in another country Im not useful I can speak english and use a computer and I can google but everyone can do that Who is gonna need meI dont care about my family If theyre strong theyll get through it They probably arent and I cant change that Weve been disconnected from each other for too long we have too many differences We can only fight and annoy each otherIm not even sure why Im writing this Not worth the effort  Nothing anyone could say is gonna change my mind Ill probably read responses maybe Ill replyIn all complete honesty my life as dumb as it sound was actually pretty good Wasnt ever hungry or thirsty I guess you could try to guilt me to stick it outBut I wont Im a selfish prick Fine I dont have any ambitions or dreams I dont want spend another eight years trying to get better Thats what the doctor said Its gonna take eight years of medicated therapy to help me Gonna have to switch meds a couple of times and go to many therapists until I find what works for me Huge risk of relapseI dont have the patience or the will to go through it again Id rather be deadIts not like Im special There are 7 billion people in the world A suicide happens every 17 minutes By the time you finished reading this someone has allready killed himherselfMaybe Ill join all of them when I go Who knows I have tied and retied a noose so its done right Been walking in the woods found a good spot far away from trails  I will take a while for anyone to find me

1	Im inventing fictional romantic stories with anime girls and watching girlfriend cuddle rp asmrs to cope with my lonelinessAt least girls in those wont judge you for your weird voice short height or autism When looking for love in the real world a man has to pretend to be someone hes not he has to wine and dine some woman and pay for her meals in a desperate bid to win her over However these in these roleplays these girls love me for who I am I dont need to change my personality in any way They just accept all my flaws and faults but love me anywayI will never expereince love Ever No girl will ever hold me
1	Just venting do not respondI have no empathy left I could never form any close relationship due to maternal abandonment at a very early age I have strong narc traits and the meds are not doing anything since I never had a chem imbalance just no girlfriendGirls were attracted 2 me but I rejected them bc of my mothers decision to place me in kindergarten at age 1 Now Now I cant match on any dating app since I have no prospects or anything else that women find attractive And they are pickier than ever in 2020 since attractive men are choosing to fuck 100s of decentlooking girls rather than marrying one good woman from the getgoMy only cope is to not think and when it fails this happens not that its negative or that I am dissatisfied with my situation I do not exist I am a part of a brain that will disolve quickla and have already shifted shapes billions of times

1	Its not worth itI tried reaching out to the chat services at the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and at imaliveorg They were both offline And I cant talk on the phone right now because it would wake the other people in the house who I dont want to know about all thisIm 26 and have been dealing with mental illness for a very long time I can recognize definitive signs by about age 11 but they were lifeendangering by 15 Its been treated onandoff and that has had some very limited success but still I think its fair to say its had a catastrophic influence on my lifeI had health insurance until my last birthday a few months ago Ive always had to pay out of pocket for my psychologist who thankfully gives me a seriously discounted rate and now I have to pay out of pocket for my psychiatrist and medication as well Or my parents do anyway Theyre so generous and kind and lovely But its more than 1000mo for those things and to be honest it doesnt even feel like its helpingIm 26 my parents are atnearing their 60s I should be on my own now not still living with them not still dependent on them for food and shelter and medicine I should be helping them or helping them help their parents not sucking them dry to the tune of more than 12KyrIts hard to see why I should continue to have them pay so much when the medicine and therapy still isnt helping I still cant hold a job I still cant consistently drive myself places My hallucinations and dissociative episodes are becoming alarmingly more frequent I suppose at least I am not so depressed that Im incapable of moving but I dont think this is betterMy parents are lovely people My siblings are lovely as are their partners My friends are lovely But I dont feel that I can talk to any of them  I dont I had the thought form in my mind a little while ago and it came so easily that I probably should be worried instead of comforted In about three months I will probably have the opportunity to kill myself and I dont really see any reason not toI mean I dont want to leave my siblings or my parents or my friends Theoretically they would be helped by having me here But thats only theoretical In practice I am only a burden I dont want to die not really I have dreams But I also realize that it is extraordinarily unlikely that I will ever achieve them and that it is not pursuing that sisyphean task when Im exhausting not just me but everyone around meI have an appointment with my counselor next week Honestly I think I would do better if I talked with her today or tomorrow but thats more money My parents want me to make an appointment with my psychiatrist for sooner because of the hallucinations but thats more money and not really any help I think I should just stop taking my medicine although I havent yetThe only thing that has saved me the last couple times I was planning to commit suicide was that I was too fucking depressed to do it Like nailedtothefloor depressed And now Im not so depressed so even if it doesnt happen until the fall it really does seem pretty plausible I dont want it  I dont think anyone does  but it seems inevitabletldr Probably checking out in September Im only getting worse and draining everyone as I go along

1	Do the thoughts ever really go awayI vividly remember thinking in my teens just make it to 20 just make it to 23 these thoughts will all be gone when youre 30 people say it gets better Lets seeI had an awful childhood My parents had 7 kids in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house We didnt eat breakfast We never brushed our teeth and rarely bathed My dad would beat us and my mom would say things like beat them I remember my sister pooping in the tub and my dad peeing in the sink when the toilet was in use I never drank or did drugs but my dad found zigzags in the couch and my mom found beer bottles in the yard waste and they always just came at me It was never meI tried to kill myself when I was 22 I still have ups and downs sure But since then Im married my husband and I are homeowners we have more money in the bank than outstanding debt We are pregnant with our 3rd kiddo and we always have food in the fridge Though I have my degree I am able to stay home with our kids for now and I know we just have it way better than mostBut Im 32 and not a day has gone by for 10 years that I havent thought about killing myself  They say its a permanent solution to a temporary problem but Im over here likeits a permanent solution to ALL my problems everAnd then people like Robin Williams and Chester Bennington and Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain Im worried Ill be 62 and it will still just plague my mindThanks for coming to my TED talk it means a lot to me
1	I have no reason to kill myselfI have everything a 30 yr old should have in life Still whats the fucking point I read your posts and I think Damn Thats fucked up If that were me I would have already pulled the trigger  See I have no reason No  woe is me story Great childhood Great family Just bought my first house Its beautiful My kids are beautiful Still Fuck it 
1	I have no meaning in my life no friends and no hopes for a better futureStarted uni this fall and its really stressful and I have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me I really like the subject but its just not worth the effort I think I expected too much going in to this I thought I was going to meet people who were like me I guess I forgot that even if those people existed I wouldnt get along because I barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions In middle school people harassed me whenever I said anything so I gradually got quieter and quieter till I just didnt say anything And I havent really recovered from that Ive basically been socially isolated till now Ive been struggling for a long time and its a miracle I managed to move to start uni I feel like this is where it ends though Im so close to giving upI dont think my life has ever felt worth living for Ive always escaped into fantasies about things being good Its lead me to make poor decisions chasing weird fantasies Ive realized this now though and Im trying to spot when I have them but I dont dare to dream about things anymore I want a nice car and house but thats not going to fix anything I think what I need is to better myself so that I can have healthy and meaningful relationships and a source of income Its just so difficult and I honestly just want to end it Im so tired of life
1	A little story of a long lost friend gone nowSo earlier this week I found out that one of my long lost pals from elementary school died I dont even know if we were really friends but thats besides the point of me writing this Its just kinda been bugging me this week others from my childhood have died but he was the first one that I actually really knew I dont know what happened I think it might have been self inflicted but Im not sure It probably doesnt matter either But theres a reason Im writing this A Facebook page was put up for him and I cant believe how many people are coming out of the figurative woodwork to say their goodbyes Even me I probably havent talked to him in 20 years or more but I had a story to share Its very touching reading everyones thoughts and it makes me a little sad that hes not here to read them That he cant tell just how much he was lovedMy point is that if you are feeling like its hopeless and that nobody would miss you if you were gone they would It might be your best friend or someone who you played with a few times as a kid and havent thought about since We still think about you and want you to know how much you have meant Give us another chance to say nice things to you instead of about you

0	My ancestor created coca cola and he was addicted too Coca cola was originally expectorant but some guy tasted it when it was cold and experienced the great mouth orgasm for the first in human history I believe he was my ancestor In his writings he explained It was something earth shattering I could feel my tongue vibrate against my teeth that created a nice sensation my whole throath was orgasming my eyes felt good He and the creator of Pepsi together fought against each other In one of his writings he describes a situation where the creator of pepsi kidnapped him tortured him with pepsi and destroyed cola bottles in front of him causing a life long depression which wasnt curable after what he saw He died when he accidentally drank Fanta The doctors said that it tasted so much like shit to him that his heart apparently killed itself It is theorized that he had cola inside his veins not blood I believe this is the case for me too
1	Whats the purpose of lifeSo today I woke up in my little room in my six share flat Today is the day I should be cramming for my first uni exam tomorrow on chemistry I havent felt the motivation to study for this exam at all I have no feelings of anxiety no butterflies nothing and Im still questioning why I think I have the ability the potential everything I need pass and do well but I just dont have the why Now is the crossroad for the rest of my life what do I do with it Then I have to ask myself whats the point in it whats my purpose I always believed that one must give them self a purpose I thought mine was to advance the human race with bionics It was a noble cause I could be proud of but I was so naive as it is so hard to achieve and none of the subjects I enjoy I just feel I must do it but do I really have to See I had moved out of home about 4 months ago I have a shitty job but I manage to make enough to put food on my plate and pay the rent thats all anyone can ask for But now I just feel like Im another wheel in the cog What is the point of living Do we live to work or work to live What is there to even live forI thought having independence would be the best thing that could happen to me and I think it was for a while But now in a building of thousands of people in a university with thousands more it feels lonelier than ever Here I have nobody apart from the people in my flat My family are a 3 hour flight away but even they are no help Coupled with the idea that the only reason Im in uni is so I can have a better paying job it just feels like I was destined to work I want to feel love true happiness that warm fuzzy feeling people keep talking about but no matter what the bigger picture always comes back and asks what Im doing with this life and how I can be useful I dont understand what keeps people ticking Is it actually sheer hope Or is it the same instinct to live that exists in any other animal It just feels like theres no tangible substance in life A heartbeat is all Ive got that separates me from my computerIm fresh out of highschool if I take a gap year Id just be disappointing and proving my dad right that moving away and straight into university was a bad idea and Im all about sticking it to the man Here I am procrastinating more and more I may as well live to work at this point but if thats the only reason to live then I might as well dieI realise that what Ive written is super muddled so kudos to anyone that understands it I know I dont I feel so disconnected I just want to feel something to remind me why Im alive and why Im doing any of this at allThanks for reading

1	How to find the will to live againRight now after losing my 2nd tech job I have little will to live and always think of how do I kill myself I did manage to get a fast food job with full time hours but that job gives me little satisfaction and I have to work nights so I cant go to social activities Im still able to have a social life because I already have friends where I live But I have a lot of debt and my job doesnt have good pay I have the option to move back home but I dont really have any friends there anymore because they all moved away And likely I will have to work another fast food job there because it will take forever to get another day job So therefore I wont be able to attend social activities to make new friends And living with my parents is going to destroy the little self esteem I have left So now I wonder how do I find some will to live again

1	Dark Realizations  Planning for the futureFor a long time I have been teetering on the living vs dying debate  Obviously I want to live but at some point it stops being worth enduring existing  Responsibilities offset this and delay death but when those responsibilities expire I dont see the point of living any longer  Yes there are experiences I have yet to have  Yes I could have happy days or even contentment but at what cost  I dont want to go through life in a medicated stupor in attempt to offset the remnants of an evolutionary advantage  Im not interested in self medicating either  If I live I want to live in sobriety and awareness   I dont see much point in existing unless Im living for the benefit of others  Martyrdom seems like a silly reason to go on existing  There is always the selfishness argument but at some point there must be a threshold where youve done enough and clocked in enough time  I am definitely not at that point yet but I will be and I know it  So when that time comes what reasons do I have to live  I can look back on my life and see happiness and regrets  I can think about what will become of my survived loved ones and create narratives where they suffer and grieve but that grief wont be about me  It will be their own regrets  Theyll wonder what they could have done differently and what could have pushed me to that point all the while knowing and understanding my struggle  Theyll regret being self absorbed like we all are and wish they could have done things differently but they cant and neither can I   Some may carry it longer than others and Ill do my best to write heartfelt notes of absolution so that they understand that I finally crossed the threshold and that it isnt their fault  Ive had practice at that  Ive written them on 3 separate occasions but someones need always overrode my need to die  I wish I would have died 15 years ago  Im already late Ive already lived too much and too long and brought even more suffering upon myself and those around me  Yes there has been happiness Im not denying that but there isnt enough and I have no means to facilitate more happiness in my life  I am and have been emotionally destitute for quite some time and Im tired of itThe joy I have in my life is illusory and deluded  I create narratives where things are different  I immerse myself in these narratives to convince myself that I am needed and that the world is better off with me here  It isnt  So what do I do  How do I stop this  I am not in any imminent danger but I have a strong sense that it will happen  I dont have any dreams left and I want nothing from the future  I am not looking forward to anything and every activity of my life is simply passing time until the inevitable end   I do not dread this end but I feel the need to test this accepted reality against the harshest of criticsThanks for reading

1	Tonight Im dying Youre the reason for itIve been battling depression for more than half my life Alone Because I have nobody in my life to help me and because people dont care about anything else than their own little special life And Im infuriated at the behavior of people today When I read comments like you have to love yourself before anyone else can love you or I dont like people who bring bad vibes or being depressed and needy is such a turnoff you know what I read I read this There is this person I see everyday a building collapsed on him hes been fighting for survival everyday since he was a kid hes bleeding his strength is leaving him his life is leaving him and hes trying to call for help but nobody answers his calls And I wont help him because hes so desperate to live thats so repulsive he should fight through the pain and lift all this shit on his own before I agree to help him Thats no different to say to someone bleeding to death to fight through the pain and when he will be strong enough to let go of the pain then and only then well call an ambulance to help him but not before Sounds crazy There is but one difference with depression The collapsed building is inside his head and you cant see it That doesnt make it any less real Im disgusted by people today Because thats what you do You refuse help to someone who needs your help to live It is literally a matter of life and death But you refuse to help him because desperation is repulsive The difference between you and me The building in your head hasnt crumbled and crashed onto you We all begin with a building that is new and well made But for some people the building begins to corrode for various reasons For other people theyre lucky enough to get love to prevent the building from decaying in the first place And when you have nobody to help you keep it from decaying it collapses When it does youre done Because nobody will help you Because people are so worried that their own building might crash that they wont help you They only want people in their life who has their shit together Because someone with a collapsed building aka depression is repulsive and not worth of love Denying someone with depression help is no different than denying someone whos drowning help Because depression is drowning Medication and therapy dont cure depression Love cures depression Andrew Solomon said depression is the flaw in love and it couldnt be more accurate But nobody will love someone who is depressed Because thats so fucking creepy rightIm done fighting depression I cant win To every person who denied me help when I called for it to every person who thought I was repulsive because I was fighting for my life and asked for some support to everyone person who laughed at me or looked at me with disgust when I asked for nothing but some sympathy some warmth some friendship you are the reason that today is my last day on earth Youre a murderer

1	Would it just be better if it was overHave you ever thought about killing yourself The sweet relief from all the pain that comes with living in this world No more worrying about girls or school or paying bills No more thoughts about past trauma or the worries of future trauma Do you ever wonder if life would be better without you that youre a burden and people would be better off without you Do you ever wish that the terrible things youve done would go away That the pain would subside into nothingness Do you ever wish you couldnt feel anymore that life was just to much This is all a part of life though I suppose Yes theres the bad but with it comes good too I have my friends and family I overall enjoy life if Im not thinking about it to hard Who would take care of my cat how would my parents and friends feel if I did leave them in this world Does this matter at all because I will never feel again and I will never know the pain I have caused from losing me Thats not me though I want to be there for everyone Happiness in others brings out happiness in me I suppose if I can bring joy to one more sole on this earth I should stick around You never know maybe life will turn out alright

1	Love Lost in TranslationHi everyoneI am a nineteen 19 year old college student in North America and my thought pattern of suicide edged itself thoroughly in my mind I have been currently attending oneonone counseling sessions I am scheduled to attend a psychiatric evaluation tomorrow Monday February 20th I have practiced meditation and I disclosed my thoughts to two of my friends butI dont feel itYes when my friends ask me what would you do if a meteorite struck me and I suddenly died I conjure up a generic response flavored with succulent adjectives For example oh I would uncontrollably quiver in a world of shock or something similarI love my friends I love my family I wish no harm unto others And I believe my suicide would result in further emotional strengthening and dynamic character understanding qualities of those I love and have not metThis excludes me I do not love myself Reasons for my selfintolerance range from physical attributes to inappropriate mental thoughts to what I eat for breakfast all of it is despicable Do others in this community feel similarly Have others experience that heartwrenching invigoration for people but not themselves Hearing my close friend Alice a pseudonym contemplate even the insignificant  like her disgust caused by eyeing a fellow customer in the gelato line wearing a red and black plaid shirt with blue and green plaid shorts  highlights my weekThe night seeps in however I am left with myself Every night I recognize the fact I lack the intellectual discipline to maintain sufficient grades I recognize the fact I lack the physical attributes of an attractive person I recognize the fact I lack the communication skills to chat with friends I recognize the fact the fact I lack love for myself I recognize the fact the fact I do not want to love myselfA suicide gesture  as my counselor calls them  occupied my last Friday night Forty minutes of me walking in middle class suburbia towards freighttrain railroad tracks and squirming to find a seat on a freshly cut tree stump represents my suicide gesture In nineteen 19 years the one last Friday marks number four 4My thoughts are scattered  I apologize for my incohesive writing I am going to try medication if my psychiatric evaluation deems it necessary however I ultimately want to be liberated from school responsibilities and financial responsibilities and even dental hygiene responsibilities Mostly I want liberation from a mind that has consistently scowled and insulted my existence I want to kill myself I need to kill myself

1	I cant take it anymoreIm getting closer and closer to ending my life my school is killing me but more importantly the person I love is my best friend That might sound good but he is a guy so am I  I know he would never love me Every second Im with him Im happy but when hes gone I lose it Also Im afraid he is becoming depressed and if he ended it I would too except I dont want to tell him that because that would a lot of pressure on him I dont know what to do I just want the pain to end And it would if I was dead
1	I tried to kill myselfI tried to cut my arms so deep that Ill bleed to death but instead I was rescued ten minutes before I died of blood loss but as much as greatful I am for being alive Im still alone and just an option in everyones life instead of a priority even my mom was just shocked for a while but she acts like it never happened and I see nothing has changed and my father keeps pointing fingers instead of telling me that its alright  or telling me well travel or getting me a thing I like and my friends are kind of avoiding me but they always did that before I did it but I didnt do it for attention but even if I did dont I deserve attention I feel like nobody cares like it ended the same way it always ends me alone in my room for two whole days no one checking on my everyone acting like it never happened and my phone only gets notifications when the power is low Like can it get more lonley  I feel so disconnected from everything and dont find much joy in anything or feel the urge to do something like all Ive ever wanted for a year or more is someone who hugs me and tells its going to be fine and I did well Am I asking for two much  like I always stand by my friends in their time of need but why do I always get that no one asked for your help you were just being extra nice  answer when I expect someone to be there for me I just remember that yesterday I regretted it all and now I dont see a reason why I mustnt try to kill myself again  like I see nothings changed

1	My life is falling apartMy girlfriend dropped a bomb on me that I cant handle My schedule is full to the brim with stuff and Im burnt out My parents dont accept the fact that Im non binary no one really cares about me I dont know what to do anymore I kind of want to see whats on the other side My depression is getting the better of me My anxiety is worse than ever and I cant deal with it
1	Need to understand mindset of a person suffering from suicidal depressionAsking on behalf of a friendMy friend knows a guy who claims to have suicidal depression often says that he will commit suicide but doesnt have the courage to do so and claims to be on antidepresents and since most of you on this forum are suffering from depression you guys will be the best people to help us understand his mindsetampx200BA little background on the guy he has been suffering from depression for more than 4 years and during the interaction my friend had with him she tried to uplift him encourage him motivate him dedicated 4 years of her life solely looking after him but the only thing which ever made him happy was earning money and lost of money Absence of money caused depression and presence of money made him super happy He has lost friends in the process because he never put any sacrifice for any relationship or put in time and efforts on any relationship be it friends or his love life He always had high expectations from people and always thought he was put on earth to be served and doesnt owe anyeone anything It is not entirely his fault because he lacks the mental ability to appreciate anyones efforts for him he even doesnt appreciate his parents efforts and thinks he has sacrificed alot for them because he ONCE gave up an opportunity to join a university of his choice on his mothers wishNow long story short he is at a point in life where he is earning alot of money and the girl my friend who was with him through thick and thin who invested time and energy on him has been discarded and not appreciated for He only fear right now is losing money because he is making alot of it He has pushed away everyone from his life because of his own atitudeNow he claims to have suicidal depression he has put a public post in which he says that he is without freinds and without love and he is suicidal So you guys suffering from major depression help me in figuring this out Does a person suffering from extreme level of depression be doing extremely good at work does a guy suffering from suicidal depression be making hell lot of money with his mind working at 100 efficiency so much so that he takes calculated risks to increase his profit margins does a guy siffering from extreme level of depression has so much presence of mind that he can perform so well He is a high risk trader and is doing volume trading which he has not done ever in his career So help me understand these contradicting statements that a person can have so much presence of mind and perform and be at the peak of his business career and still claim to be suicidal or was the public post just a tantrum he threw How does the mind of a depression patient workHe also enjoys weekends with friends playing poker although there is a rift in that friendship but he spends staurday nights there to have fun and relax his mindMy friend was worried for him after seeing public post of suicide on one of the platform which he later deleted in a day but she was really worried but fails to understand teh behaviour Seeking guidance from people who are really at the verge of suicide how well is yoru concentration ability how do u perform at work how is ur career growth how do you feel does your brain work at its optimal level during suicidal depressionHe has had 3 breakups all of which according to him was the girls faults whereas the other party always suffered greatly due to him not doing any efforts for the relationhip cheating no care and lack of attention given to relationship Can the whole world be wrong and hes right He thinks all his exs are wrong he has pushed my friend who has burnt midnight oil to take care of him selflessly and pushed her away as well the moment his life got on track and he started making money He only used people to his advantage until they are needed in his life and than claims to have depression because of no people in his life while still working well and doing what he loves doing the most making money For him money is worshipped and is categorized above any human being

1	Im cant handle thisIve been depressed since I can remember at first it was just laziness and no caring about my well being  Weed definitely helped it forced my mind into a fake state of happiness and I did my best to never be sober As the stress from debt piling up and exhaustion from getting next to no sleep every night for months on end added to everything else I couldnt handle it My roommates girlfriend gave us bedbugs would steal from me constantly and would take my car whenever she wanted causing a huge commotion if she didnt get her way My job was illegally screwing me out of money I needed to pay my bills but I could afford to do anything my teeth started to fall apart and decay to the point of no return my friends spent less and less time with me each day I was done After going and getting ready for my choice of leaving this world I texted my goodbyes to the ones I cared about the most posted my note on Facebook and set out on my path to find a quiet place to give up Im still not sure if this was fortunate or not but I had a wellness check called on me and I was picked up by the police and placed in a hospital I thought I got better since then most of the problems still remained but I was chipping away at my debt and found someone I love more than anything it was going good until I lost my job After working there for three years management changed for the third time and the new head manager wanted her son to have my position so they made my life a living hell there wasnt a day I wouldnt get chewed out for at least half an hour Im so lost as to what to do anymore I wake up in the morning and am angry that I woke up completing suicide sounds better as each day passes I cant get myself out of this debt there arent many jobs in my area and even with buying the bare minimum for essentials I still cant make a living at any other jobs I want to give up I guess you could say this is sort of my note Im going to give it myself 2 days to try figuring out this problem I havent been able to fix before I end it for good Thank you for reading all the way through if you did it means a lot to me to be heard

0	My opinion on reddit I found out about reddit in a PewDiePie video I thought it sounded cool so I downloaded it I had never had social media up until that point so this was an interesting occasion At first I was confused It seemed like you could look up anything and there would be a subreddit on it I thought social media was somethings that everyone had to have the same opinion But as time went on it because clear There are many different people on the internet so there needs to be a place where people an opinion can talk to people with the same opinion without being ridiculed by people with different opinions  Most social media apps only have a like situation but reddit allows you to say hey I dont like that without having to comment under the post In real life I dont have many friends but on reddit social popularity doesnt matter Were all just a group of outcasts who come together to make a community of wonderful people who can share their things that they would never say in real life Dont be afraid to be yourself Were all beautiful in our own way Share your opinion and if we get downvoted than we must accept that some people dont have the same ideas as us Reddit is wonderfulReddit is horribleReddit is diverseThank you for coming to my Ted talk

1	In a pointless downward spiral  no clue how to crawl outIll try to keep this as brief as possible  despite having wonderful friends an even more wonderful girlfriend and a complete inability to panic I am stuck in a default state of horrendous depression and only escape it by distracting myself with things like video games drinking or sex I was in college for a year dropped out to take an amazing job halfway across the country and then was justifiably let go after only three months due to being generally incompetent at my unbelievably simple retailoriented It took me nearly half a year to find another job only to be let go once more after just one month for what I can only assume was general incompetence youre just not the right fit for our company was the most detail they gave and I felt I was doing a great job until then I was hired at a place that gives very sporadic work not long after and am only making enough money to pay for foodbus fare while my increasingly fedup father has been paying my rent and bills I keep searching for work albeit without much heart because my problem is that things just feel utterly hopeless on a cold impossibletoignore logical level I feel stupid and incapable of pulling off even the most basic of adult functions which leads to depression which leads to me moping around and not doing anything which leads to proving the point and angry room mates screaming about the messes I dont clean up and on and on and on and on Suicide in my convoluted logic isnt so much a oneway ticket to a painfree state of being as it is a logical step to remove myself as a burden to everyone around me The only thing keeping me from going through with it is the very laziness and lack of motivation that brings about the feeling in the first place  Id have to push myself pretty hard to buy something to do the deed with or crawl up an abandoned building somewhereTLDR no matter how much work I do to try and free myself I am completely stuck in life so im left with no motivation to keep on trying

1	Im slipping and Im afraidPart of me wants to live Part of me wants to fight Part of me sees my potential and wants to strive to reach itBut Ive been slipping further towards my death Ive made attempts in the past Overdoses mainly It was a surprise when I survived each time I was content as I shut my eyes and waited for things to end My most recent overdose I was nearly sure itd be fatal as it wasnt a spontaneous attempt and I had done quite a bit of research Im still not sure how I survivedI feel like another attempt is building up Ive been making arrangements for it and sometimes like as I write this Im afraid I feel like its going to happen and my plans this time are with a method that would only fail if theres a miracle 10 seconds of intent and Im unconscious with being a vegetable in less than 10 minutes and being dead in less than 10 more minutes If I can make it through those 10 seconds without backing out Ill die unless someone interrupts me Im not rushing into this so Im pretty sure Id be able to guarantee my privacyIm intelligent generally pretty kind decently attractive and good at almost anything I put my mind to but sometimes I just cant see any hope It doesnt help that my depression and anxiety issues have manifested into pretty severe agoraphobia either Sometimes I wish I could just go get therapy but I cant even manage the go part except on rare occasionsTheres only one person I know that I have enough rapport built up with that I really feel like I can talk to and they went full non communication weeks ago They told me it was for my benefit too acting like it would help me Having a friend that I trusted was what was helping me though Having someone to play online games with and talk to was helping me Always losing everyone I feel close to doesnt helpI feel like a prisoner stuck in a cell of my own making I want to escape I want to find love I want to have children someday and try to give them all the happiness I couldnt find for myselfI know I can survive but I believe I cant I know I can do great things but I believe I cant I know I can do things to improve my situation but I believe I cant Im tired of fighting myself
1	An illogical desire to leave this worldIll preface this by saying that I feel like Im a weird case  Twentyone year old college junior at a lovely midwestern US university perfect grades decent friends etc  I sincerely think that Im intelligent and likeable  No history of other suicide attempts though I first encountered suicidal thought at the age of about 13 or so  I feel like it is a phasic feeling and that this phase will likely pass as wellIm studying to become a science educator and I have very little reason at this point to think that this has been a bad decision  Nevertheless my career path seems to be a major source of stress for me  Im not sure how else to expand on this but Im sure the potential for career difficulty in the field of education is a widely understood thing  Science is my passion and I would love nothing more than to help people understand this Universe a little bit better  I just dont know if I can be a good educator yet because Ive only studied education in theory so far  Sometimes I wonder if being a teacher is too easy for how I gauge myself in intelligence  I also feel that education is a field that needs the most intelligent people in the world which is how I derive my calling to the profession  My first field experiences begin next semester and I feel like they will enlighten meI have a considerable amount of student loans though not nearly as much as some other students so I feel lucky there  Finances are definitely another source of stress however  Im on the cusp of becoming independent from family support and I dont know if I will be able to do it  I am a stringent saver and I feel like I could live quite simply and still be happyI just feel like Im at an event horizon related to my adulthood and that I cant see whats in my future so my mind races to all the worst possibilities  What if I have to move back in with my parents  What if I would rather be a homeless drifter than fail at independence  What if I just go as far as my gas tank and bank account will take me so I can see some of the world before I give up entirely  What if I just found some quick method of ending my life so I wouldnt have to worry any moreIm having a hard time seeing the difference between an oblivious neutral suicide and oscillation between positive and negative in the living world  I feel like they are equivalent  My biggest roadblock is in not wanting to disappoint the people that know me  Ive always worried so much about disappointing othersTo add on to this I feel so guilty for wanting to educate people when I cant even claim to have a good grip on my own life  Shouldnt a teacher be stable and confidentI just wish I had a sustainable career to work at and a place to live by myself  I would do anything to have more faculty over my own privacy  Currently I live with an elderly relative near campus to save money on living expenses  Im grateful for this opportunity but it is extraordinarily depressing and stressful  I see the demise of my own intellect in the senile population  I feel that I would rather die before the dulling of my own mindSo I humbly thank whoever reads this  I feel that its obvious that this is more an exercise for myself than an actual outreach for advice but I would love perspective on my situation from any redditors replies  I know that my life is always beautiful in hindsight and that living a full life of challenges and difficulties can be remembered lovingly  I know that there are ups and downs and that I will likely not feel suicidal next week  Even with all of this information I cant draw the logic to desire to keep living

1	I will never be in a happy relationshipI have an awkward sexual orientation Im homoromanticheterosexual As the name implies I basically only fall in love with guys but only have sexual feelings for women There are some exceptions I can like a girl and I am somewhat attracted to guys just not below the waistSo I dont think that a longterm relationship is realistic for me If I commit to a women I will never love her And if I commit to a man I will never be able to have a sex lifeId be ok with falling in love with a man living together and just rarely or never having sex But I know that no one else would be ok with that kind of lifeSo without love is life worth living I dont think so
